7,,,"“I am Indian citizen by birth have lived here for 58 years. I have another 10-12 years to live if they want to send me to Bangladesh so be it.” . .

#HumansOfAssam is a collection of stories of people living in the state who fear losing their Indian citizenship. It is part of the month-long reporting project called #TheFinalCount. More than 19 lakh people have been excluded from Assam’s final NRC list that was published on Saturday. BJP minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the SC should allow re-verification of names for a ‘correct and fair NRC’; former Assam CM Tarun Gogoi blamed the BJP while the Trinamool Congress claimed Centre was trying to drive Bengalis out of Assam. . .

Rupa Dutta’s father Krishna Pada Dutta Choudhury was made the honorary principal of the Tinsukia Commerce College when it was carved out of the Tinsukia College in 1972 in the eponymous Upper Assam district. It was an acknowledgment of his many years of service as a teacher in the Tinsukia College. . .

However her father’s glowing legacy has not helped 58-year-old Rupa Dutta a homemaker from Guwahati convince the authorities updating Assam’s National Register of Citizens so far that she is not an “illegal migrant” from Bangladesh.
.
.
To be eligible for inclusion in the NRC an applicant has to prove that they or their ancestors were in India before the midnight of March 24 1971.
.
.
Rupa Dutta’s struggle to prove her citizenship is primarily a result of a sudden dislocation that took place in the family in the early 2000s when her mother’s health suddenly deteriorated. After Krishna Pada Dutta Choudhury death in 1994 Rupa Dutta’s mother had been living alone in the family’s Tinsukia home. “But then she fell very ill and could not manage by herself” she said. “So sometime in the early 2000s me and my husband went to Tinsukia packed all her stuff in a matter of days and got her along with us.” In the rush a lot of things were left behind including Krishna Pada Dutta Choudhury’s documents.

__________________________

Birosmoni Das struggles to complete a sentence without breaking down. But this much she remembers clearly: her son Bhaben Das did not sleep a wink on the night of March 2. The next morning as the day broke he went out clutching a thick wad of papers: documents he would furnish at a hearing in neighboring Kalaigaon in Udalguri district ten days later to prove his and Birsomoni Das’s citizenship.
Both mother and son had been left out of Assam’s draft National Register of Citizens a list which aims to sift “illegal immigrants” from bonafide Indian citizens. The draft list was published on July 30 2018 while the final list is slated for release on July 31 2019.
At the hearing conducted by an NRC official they could make one last claim to citizenship.
Bhaben Das 50 returned home around 8 am put the documents back in their original place in a rusty black trunk and said “Ma I am not going to touch these papers again.” Then he stepped out again.
Minutes later he was found hanging to a nearby tree. According to the postmortem report Das died of asphyxia – lack of oxygen – “following suicidal hanging”. Click on the link in our bio to read the full story.

Ram Bahadur Chhetry has been making phone calls to acquaintances at odd hours sounding disoriented and hassled. He is a 55-year-old man who teaches at a lower primary school in Assam’s Baksa district. The cause of Chhetry’s distress is the National Register of Citizens – a list being drawn up of genuine Indian citizens living in Assam. To be included in the list applicants have to prove they or their ancestors had entered India before the midnight of March 24 1971 the eve of the Bangladesh war.
.
.
.
Chhetry had made it to a draft list released in July 2018 – only to be told last month that he had been wrongly included.
.
.
.
He was among the 1.02 lakh people featured in a fresh exclusion listpublished by the NRC authorities on July 26. This list the NRC authorities said included people who had been declared foreigners by tribunals or who had cases pending there as well as people disfranchised by the Election Commission and marked “D” or “doubtful” voters on the suspicion of being undocumented migrants from Bangladesh.
.
.
.
Chhetry was in neither category. Instead he was found ineligible while appearing as a witness to support his sister’s claim for citizenship in March.

At 8.30 am on Republic Day 2014 Scroll.in published its first article. “Ambedkar dreaming: Constitution’s architect talks of his hopes for new India” said the headline. In the constantly mutating world of the internet we weren’t quite sure what shape our publication would assume. But we set ourselves an expansive goal: to cover “the news that matters and the things that make life worth living”. In those early days months away from a crucial national election our small team of reporters travelled the length and breadth of the country to bring you dispatches that foregrounded the concerns of ordinary Indians – voices that were being drowned in the sound and fury of the political campaign.

Five years and approximately 121664 pieces later just over ten million readers every month affirm that we are their trusted news source. Many of them are subscribers who help support our award-winning journalism.

As our team has grown so has the number of sections on Scroll.in. Each weekday dawns with Your Morning Fix a news show produced by our Video team. “The Latest” provides updates on the news as it breaks. “The Field” proves that India is interested in sporting action beyond the cricket pitch. “The Reel” reflects the fact that India is home to many more film genres than just Bollywood. “Magazine” brings you stories about art and food quirks of history and eccentric tales. “Books and Ideas” has a sharp focus on the literary world with reviews and trend pieces. “Pulse” reports on the state of India’s health.

We are months away from the national election. Before the storm of sloganeering begins we want reflect on the five years that have gone by.

For those seeking facts over opinion we have put together a series of informationally rich and rigorously researched articles on #TheModiYears. The project revisits the key milestones and initiatives of the Modi government and examines their impact on our national life.

It becomes possible for any woman to do. Make something up and completely ruin someone. And that power should not be held by anyone. Let alone half of the world. Would you trust half of the world with just being a good enough person to never push the button?There needs to be diplomatic investigation and verifiable evidence. Because that’s just logical.

Not false claims? 🤔|When will these morons be held accountable for blocking public roads|I'm not saying don't believe rape survivors because I think sexual assault is the worst thing that one could do besides murder but women do make up false rape allegations (no I'm not saying real rape victims are lying) but the girls who do make up false rape allegations give the real sexual assault survivors a bad name and that's why everyone nowadays questions rape victims and don't pretend like girls don't make false rape accusations because it does happen for those of you who have actually been sexually assaulted and come forward even though you've been scared I commend you and I think you are very brave human beings.|I don't get it, no man has ever been condemned arbitrarily and if you are innocent, then your life won't be destroyed through false allegations either. No one's saying that women should be believed at all times. They're saying that given that there's so much disincentive for women to come out, we mustn't arbitrarily assume they are lying. But I agree that due process here doesn't yield verifiable results. The way we go about solving murders isn't the same approach you can use to determine what happened several years ago. The fact remains that people are likely to be biased in favour of men rather than women, and there is rarely true neutrality. As for Kavanaugh, I think he showed throughout the hearings that he isn't exactly the optimum candidate for being a SC judge, regardless of the accusations.

Photos of the animal have been sent to experts for identification said Ketki Jog a member of the Konkan Cetacean Research Team. Meanwhile authorities called in hydraulic cranes to dispose off the whale's carcass. They had initially planned to transport the body to Navi Mumbai but later decided to simply bury at 5 km away at a secluded spot on the same beach. 
After 5 hour long hours the authorities finally managed to hoist the whale on a truck and while it made it's way past the crowd a senior citizen prayed silently for the departed mammal. Photo by @riteshuttamchandani

On the morning of August 26 the day after Hardik Patel's showcase rally in Ahmedabad 14-year-old Sanjay Thakor was bitten by a snake. The venom was acting fast and his panicked family rushed him to the nearest hospital. But Sanjay lived in Gangapura an inconspicuous village of just 13 homes 75 kilometres from Ahmedabad. The nearest hospital was in Mehsana city. 
When they got there Sanjay was barely conscious but the hospital staff didn't admit him. ""They asked for a Rs 15000 deposit. And said we had to file a police case first"" said Somaji Thakor Sanjay's uncle. ""A police case for a snake bite! Did they want us to sue the animal?"" When Sanjay was finally admitted in the afternoon another problem cropped up. The Patel rally in Ahmedabad had turned violent the previous night Gujarat was preparing to bring army troops into its cities and there were curfews everywhere. ""Many of the doctors must have been Patidars. Because of the curfew only two doctors showed up that day managing all the patients in the hospital"" said Somaji. ""No one attended Sanjay for a long time and when they did he was not treated properly."" On the evening of August 26 as tensions between Patels and the police in Gujarat grew 14-year-old Sanjay Thakor died of the snake bite. Read more on Scroll.in.

Pushing 200 kilograms of coal tied to his bicycle in gunny sacks Raju Ansari had reached only mid-way through his 60-kilometres long journey to Ranchi. Until last year Ansari paid individual bribes every time he passed a police checkpoint along the road to Ranchi. But now his group of koilawallas have entered into an arrangement with three high school graduates from the area who own motorbikes and vans. “Each of us pays Rs 50 to the motorbike owners who pull us through the most difficult incline in Chutupallu Ghati by tying our bicycles to their seats” he said. 
But not all koilawallas are fans of this new motorized assistance. Some like Samlal Munda who is in his late 40s said the motorists charge steep rates. How many koilawallas can afford to shell out Rs 50 he asked.

Others like Tileshwar Mahto said what may seem like greater ease is also fraught with risk. “If you lose your balance while the motorcycle is pulling the bicycle trips the coal bags tear and nothing can be salvaged” he said. He claimed to have heard of seven accidents in the last two years in which koilawallas fell off their bicycles while the motorists were pulling and got crushed by the trucks approaching from behind.

It might seem like social media sites are saturated with photos of donuts and ‘dogs who fail’. But millions of photos on social media sites such as Facebook Flickr and Picasa are coming to the aid of biodiversity researchers. These photos are helping them track species in areas they are not able to access.
Over the past few years citizen science has helped map a diverse range of species from bats to slender lorises to moths to invasive species. Vijay Barve who has been part of various citizen science groups on butterflies and moths studied how naturalists are sharing images.
“I tried to harvest info from Flickr and was surprised to find a lot and was able to produce maps of species of conservation concern” he said.

Young paddy was being transplanted in water-filled fields. In the distance one could see the gentle forested hills of Niyamgiri. Later in that trip travelling down to Rayagada the road kept rising and falling along the gentle contours of the land. On both sides more fields and the odd clump of forests. Read more on Scroll.in.

The statue as you have already realised if you have seen the 2009 James Cameron film Avatar is of its protagonist Jake Sully in his “avatar” form. Sully is not alone. To make sure he has company the Vijayawada authorities have placed Neytiri the female lead and his love interest just a few steps away. So what are statues of two Hollywood characters doing on a narrow strip of green opposite the Police Control Room in one of the smaller cities of Andhra Pradesh?  According to The Hindu the statues are to give the school book-ish message: “Protect your environment and your environment will protect you.” But perhaps the more convincing answer lies in how Vijayawada wants to position itself.

As the myth behind the Rato Machendranath goes Kathmandu Valley had experienced draught and famine for 12 years and the then king and his subjects were unaware of its cause. But with the help of a saint they learned that Lord Gorakhnath had held the rains as he was angered by the Nags when he had come to Kathmandu and had kept them under his custody. To appease Gorakhnath people pulled the chariot of Machhendranath (father of Goraknath) with all their vigour and energy. The Nags were soon set free and finally it rained. Since then the people of Nepal have been pleasing the god (Rato Machendranath) in the form of festival that last for about six months (December- June).
