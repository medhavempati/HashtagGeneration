4,,,"“While there are benefits to the old paradigm of meditation I believe movement and flow are where things are going” says @DrJinju Dasalla. She has taught flow arts at our festivals and she says “These practices optimize the whole brain and body function by activating opposing patterns of movement thus creating new pathways in the brain and body that bring about new ways of being.”

Tonight’s full moon in Libra corresponds with the vernal equinox—this happened last in 2000 and 1981. It’s an auspicious time to take stock of what equilibrium looks like and what you need to shed or evolve or galvanize to get there 🌚
The equinox marks the start of the astrological year and Aries season but coming on the tail of Uranus transiting into Taurus it’s more than a new beginning. It’s the integration of lessons learned the release of outdated pattens and represents a willingness to make different choices 🌱

We want more of this @wanderlustfest ❤️❤️❤️|You’re an inspiration ❤️|@sarahsapora Yes!!!! @wanderlustfest bring inclusivity to your events. I have wanted to attend for years now but feel like I would have stood out. I know I shouldn’t think that but I do. I see your ads and think I don’t look like these people that are enjoying themselves. Invite all to be welcome and we will come! Invite teachers that look different and we will feel more at home. Thanks for listening.|Love love love ✨ @sarahsapora|Hello @sarahsapora so good to see you on this page.|It is about time you walked into your light! Fuck ya...this is so important.

Her content was life changing for me as a high schooler trying to make sense of diet culture and the ways it perpetuates and monetizes self hatred|I’ve been to three Wanderlust festivals and have yet to see someone like @sarahsapora teach or speak there. Women’s items in the clothing tent didn’t go beyond a small looking XL. I think this article is amazing and Sarah makes excellent points but until Wanderlust puts this vision of body diversity into practice it will keep missing the mark.|It's really nice to see my body type represented in wellness for  a change!

I bought the premium bundle so I already have those items. I want to sign up again for the upcoming Dallas 108. Should I just buy the regular ticket since I already have the mat tote and fandana? Or are there other perks to buying the premium bundle again? I just don’t want to spend a ton again if it’s really just the tote and mat that are extras. Thanks!|💚|Plant envy! 💚|Become the person you need to see💛 so beautiful|Wowyes!! Love you!!💖|Wow I was amazed and happy when I saw this normal looking beautiful woman posted on your Instagram page! I would never consider going to something like @wanderlustfest because I would be too worried that I would be very judged there for my size. The sad thing is though for me and probably many other woman I live with an invisible illness. I live in constant severe pain. I’ve had migraines everyday for eleven years. I take loads of medications and am practically bedridden. So I’m not only overweight but incredibly weak. This kind of festival would be so meaningful and healing for people like me. We could learn so much about how to help heal our bodies. Or I wish I could go to yoga classes in my town on Oahu. But I not only worry about my size not be acceptable but my incredible weakness my inability to even stand very long or struggle to stand from a sitting position. I feel like I I would have to explain to the teacher and class why I’m so bad but I hate to make excuses. Maybe someday I’ll gain the courage or become healthier.

Understanding. Open-minded. Respect.|😍😍😍|Love this we need more plus size role models 💗💗💗|I hear you!|Sara's post is my story. I am plus size and 47. Approximately 8-9 years ago I took community yoga classes at a wellness center and the teacher I had was wonderful! She worked with all the students helped with modifications went as slowly as needed. Then she left. The new teacher went through the poses so fast and never once asked if we were doing ok. I finished the first class and never went back. I  have never went to yoga again because I'm afraid I can't keep up. I wanted to but I didn't want to be embarrassed. I know I shouldn't feel that way but it's hard being the biggest person in the room. I love that Sara is opening this conversation up. 💜|Looking gorgeous as ever!  Love her!|Wellness is for everyone no matter what size you are!!|This is exactly what I needed to see today🙏🏻🙌🏻♥️|💚💚💚|🙌🙌|Love Sarah's energy and vibe!!! Rise Up ❤❤❤|❤️❤️❤️|Fantastic piece by @sarahsapora ! Applauding every point and love that this conversation has been opened up. ❤️|❤️❤️❤️|Luv your article thanks for sharing. What I luv about yoga is that yoga is about love acceptance non judgement and just becoming an observer in the present moment I believe that 's when true healing love appreciation and recognition of our true authentic intrinsic self worth and value can be felt.|My beautiful friend @sarahsapora ❤️❤️❤️|Well if it isn't my favorite Kundalini babe!  I wouldn't have even considered it if it wasn't for you breaking the barrier of my understanding that in my larger body I can modify as I need and no one has to give me that permission. ❤️ You @sarahsapora|Wonderful! 😄💗☀️|Way to go girl!!! ❤️|😍 Love @sarahsapora!|@sarahsapora is such an inspiration and is doing such important work! 💜|Love love love this and  @sarahsapora!!!!|This is beautiful!

The reality is that YOU ARE RIGHT and there has to be more representation! Thank you @sarahsapora for being a voice for those who have been silenced for too long. 💜💚|Thank you. I am plus size and have MS. The number of classes/professionals I have seen that are not size or disability inclusive is dishartening. I often get fobbed off with my weight rather than someone asking about my needs relating to my MS which is invisible but still impacts my overall wellness - probably more than my weight! @sarahsapora your fight that every body deserves wellness is heartwarming and highlights the need for change. You give me the courage to speak out about how I am treated by others when all they see is my weight and have little regard for my wellness 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏|I was overtly body shamed at a class this week by the instructor nonetheless. It wasn’t the first time but it had been a while. It was a staunch reminder of how not inclusive the wellness industry is. I wish I could say that I let the experience roll off my back but it triggered a lot of feelings of doubt and shame that I am still sorting through as part of my journey to overall wellness. I felt like I didn’t deserve to be there and that I shouldn’t go back. This encouraged me to go tomorrow. Thank you.|Exactly. This is everything.. 😍 Thank you|She's amazing!!! And I feel her! Anytime I ever go to yoga I'm always the one who's not flexible skinny etc. It was hard to go. But once you decide your why...who cares what you look like or how good you are. You are there for you!!!|I love it! Be the change you want to see! You’re doing it! You’ve done it! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 Super proud of you. You look fabulous btw! 🔥|Thank you for bringing this conversation to the front!|Enabling this is incredibly selfish. I’ve seen with my own eyes people in wheel chairs people with prosthetic legs Veterans with severe PTSD disabled people of all walks of life get themselves to a gym and never feel sorry for themselves. Shame on all of you who have health issues and use that as an excuse to remain where you are and never go forward. I’m a disabled Veteran but I still get my ass to the gym.|Being able to go to an event and not feel like I escaped from the circus. I walk funny with an arm crutch believe me I know. But the beauty is is that I was in a wheelchair. For a long time. And I retaught myself to walk. Sure the walk isn’t pretty. But I freaking WALK! When I show up to yoga or cycle or the gym I want to be treated like I have every right to be there even if I’m not 100%. Support not stares. ❤️|@thesparkledlife I love support not stares! That is so true and so amazing. Great article. I have often felt like this. What would be all of the things I would have done if I never felt this way?|🏆❤️|❤️💪🏽|You feel like an outsider in your own community when you literally can’t fit into spaces. It’s time to make space for all sizes and abilities instead of just telling those people that it’s not for them because they don’t fit.

@sarahsapora Is the real deal. In a world so focused on what is wrong with us and all the work we need to do to earn our place in the often judgmental spaces for wellness; Sarah offers joy and hope and love in this very moment. And it has allowed us to pause- breathe - and celebrate who we are in the now. And to get excited about self-discovery- so that we can be all that we were meant to be and MORE.  A powerful yogi and beautiful role model for us all inside and out 😘✨💛 Namaste🙏🏼|Please be my mentor in life|💞|Thank you for including a body that looks like me!

It has not  stopped me from going to Kundalini yoga I love it. The practice has helped to heal so many parts of my life. Asana yoga is another story.

There are so many other vehicles that can be utilized to raise one’s level of consciousness. All I can say is try something. Love you Sarah! ♥️☀️🌸|So psyched to see not just a larger body but specifically Sarah's message.

I had been lifting weights and going Zumba and thought I’d try something more difficult-CrossFit. After the intro classes I began joining the lunch workouts. Everyone there was fit and could do handstand push-ups. I was fine with modifying but I couldn’t even do the modified move. I left during the middle of class crying all the way to the car and didn’t exercise until 1 1/2 years later.|You are beautiful! 💖|OMG yes!!!|🙌🙌🙌💕|@sarahsapora is amazing!

Love it ❤️|Haribol Gentle Soul|❤️❤️❤️ Love this 🙌🏼|I feel this. I am rather used to it though being the oddball plus size girl in power vinyasa classes. Being an instructor and studio owner was infinitely harder. People would offhandedly comment about how they couldn’t see themselves “taking an exercise class from someone who can’t take care of themselves” when I lost a lot of weight I gained a big following when I gained it back people stopped coming. I sold my studio and haven’t been teaching much and I’ve been happier. It didn’t bother me much to be the fat girl at Wanderlust last I was there although I did get some curious looks from the students who attended the session I taught that year. People will always judge even though it’s yoga and we preach a lot about not judging. I think there are those who fear being around fat because they fear becoming it themselves. Life happens autoimmune stuff happens it is what it is. I am always happy to see inclusivity when I come across them almost thought that could be me in this picture!|Representation is so important. There are so many women who don’t look like me sharing their journeys with wellness.

I haven’t won a sweepstakes ever before but I’m feelin’ lucky because my dad is always super lucky and he’s not even on Instagram. He’s just lucky at life as in he always gets front row parking or wins money on $2 scratch off tickets.

The new year kicks off with one of the most powerful new moons and a solar eclipse in Saturn-ruled Capricorn. 🌑 ♑  Capricorn concerns itself with the past such as history or tradition and roots. Connect to this Earthly dimension with good ol' fashioned Tree Pose or Vrksasana. 🌳 Before beginning the posture spend extra time balancing the four corners of the feet on the ground and imagining your roots growing down into the Earth.

129,,,"Crystals represent pieces of nature and history that existed before us and which will remain long after. When looking at crystals for Halloween the most important ones fall into two camps: Stones that protect your energetic field (ie: keep you sane) and stones that can help you connect to the spiritual world.
⥈
Amethyst is most commonly known as the must-have crystal to use when accessing the 3rd-Eye Chakra and one’s intuition. In its protection role it helps to clear the energy of bad influences and attachments. In its connector role Amethyst allows the higher mind to communicate with one’s guides and angels to tap into one’s true inner-self.

⥈
Valerian is an herb that might just be your solution for a good night’s sleep. The roots of the plant are where the magic medicine lies and it’s commonly found in products that help improve sleep patterns and build defenses against stress. You can take it as a tincture capsule (try @swisseusa Ultiboost Sleep tablets) or in a tea.
⥈
Some say that yoga nidra (commonly referred to as yogic sleep) is even more restful than regular shut-eye. Yoga nidra involves finding a quiet room for up to 20 minutes getting comfortable on the floor and using a pillow or bolster to position yourself to fully relax. Try getting this uber-nap once a week and see how it starts to unwind your nervous system.
⥈
Meditation gives you all sorts of benefits like enhanced REM sleep and increased levels of melatonin. If you’re looking for some relief when it’s time to hit the pillow a simple 6-minute meditation can prepare you in both body and mind for a full night’s rest.

Trust your gut! Artichokes are an excellent source of fiber and are full of antioxidants. The combination of which helps keep you regular and protects cells from free radical damage. Whether you stuff them bake them or take them as a part of a supplement blend (we're looking at you @swisseusa Ultiboost Liver Detox) artichokes are one of the more delicious ways to detox your daily diet.

Here is my response.... Jessica

Enough of this waffle. 
This is a copy and paste of an email I received previously. And it’s all about you. If there was a sorry ingredient in this waffle mixture I couldn’t discern it from all the baloney.

And just like a baloney waffle it sounds unappetising and leaves a extremely bad taste in my mouth.

You talk more about your sorry “reputation” than the hurt you have caused many people by not paying what you owe.

Can I suggest you spend less time thinking about your reputation and blaming others and more time doing something constructive about your reputation like paying me and the hundreds of others you owe money too. It was your negligence that has put us all in this position. It is a weak argument. 
Don’t blame bad partners when the partnership is two entities. You need to grow up as you are dealing with peoples lives here and livelihoods. Can I suggest you go to the nearest mirror and look at yourself. That person looking back at you owes me money that I need. When I entered into this partnership all of my correspondence and contract was with Wanderlust- I was not even aware I was dealing with a licensee. Your name and sign off was with everything. 
And you continue to pile on with this drivel.

Blah blah blah pay me please. I earned this money.|@jkells19 Yass❤️ Queens of the wild🦒|Hi @wanderlustfest do u not do any Australian events any longer?|@gugaverse 😍😙|@kathythekween ❤|@lrimola215|My sweet @linds.lo|@jdawww 🤗💘|@dinacerbone !!❤️|@anhellickuh truly the queens of the 707!!

400,,,"Happy #ValentinesDay a day typically associated with romance dinner dates and boxes of chocolate. Those things might make you feel wonderful or they might not. But whether you’re happily coupled or single and stoked (or anywhere in between) the true power of today lies in taking stock of all our relationships: with a partner with friends with family and most important of all with ourselves. Maybe you’re newly in love or maybe you’re heartbroken. You could feel lonely or tired or stuck. Or overjoyed! The point is: feel your feelings. Be honest with yourself. There’s no one way you’re supposed to feel today but acknowledging your emotions is the first step in honoring that oh-so important relationship with yourself. 💖

Sagittarius ♐️: Take your time. We'll be here.
Capricorn ♑️: If there's one holiday movie you watch this year make it ""The Star Wars Holiday Special.""

Plus hotel stays etc.|@jamiediana heard. Though I drove 24 hours and camped and volunteered and made it work. (And now I work here). Where there's a will...|@wanderlustfest I agree with @jamiediana I am also from Ontario and I would love to go to more events but don't have the means to do so. As a national organization I would hope and expect that wanderlust would be more understanding instead of telling their customers to try harder.|I'm on the same boat with @jamiediana and @oliviajohnson28 I would more then love attending more events specially after attending wanderlust here in Toronto and not only having it rain on us but having the event run short and be poorly organized. Either way with events being so far it's to expensive to not only travel but also find a place to stay and pay for the event. 😕😩 @wanderlustfest instead of telling us to put more effort in Perhaps try to bring more events to this area next year 😁🎉 I'm sure the three of us would more then love to attend|I have to agree with @jamiediana @oliviajohnson28 & @dmr4df I would love to have more events like these closer to Toronto area as Jamie said its hard to make a long trip to some of these events living off of a student budget! I attended the 108 festival in Toronto and had a lot of fun however it would be nice to have something a little bigger😁☺️|I also know many people who are on the same page as all of us and who would love to see something like this come our way in the future|All my favourites 😱😭 so excited wow!!! Thanks @wanderlustfest|@dmr4df hey -- wasn't telling anyone their efforts weren't sufficient. Was just explaining that there are ways to afford and be a part of the events that we do have. The company is growing quickly and there's no telling how many new events we'll add over the next few years but in the meantime I wanted to make sure you knew that there are options and opportunities to be a part of the events we do currently have.|Gorgeous 💙☀️🙏🏼|@iseeshasta Could happen 🌿|👌|@lazer_hawk how about this for tassels ?|@frankiemayb yes!!|@saharaclemmers fringgeeeesssssss|@sweetlovin88 😀✌🚀💑|@pikela quiero algo así,2253

865,,,Many of our attendees travel great distances to come to Wanderlust events. We try to mitigate the impacts that driving and flying can have on our planet by offering carbon offset options on each ticket purchase. For each dollar you donate @TreesWaterPeople plants 5 trees. In 2014 you donated enough money to plan 20450 trees and helped offset 204500 tons of CO2. This year you've almost blown 2014 out of the water already and donated enough money for 17500 trees to be planted.

921,,,Happy Saturday! Here is a half-wolf half husky named Taco. Because puppies. For more puppies and other epic adventures follow our friends @sashajuliard and @gldmne. #FindYourTrueNorth,findyourtruenorth,|@lhfortino|@enseevee TACO!!!|@wcr_art this was meant for you!|@ken_bird|@k9smitho|@alexislexiss|@unclebum|@tcasmarcus|@zznewlands !!!!|@leledoggy|@quintenhansen_|@scanak I would trade my baby for this nugget.|@scootermikes so stinkin adorable! And his name is taco!! I love it|@saraheidi because puppies|@eileenf0rward  our dog|Just because it's possible doesn't mean that you should... Wolf hybrids are not something you should intentionally seek to breed. 😔 it sends a terrible message.  This is a little disappointing to see from this feed.  Just my two cents.  Taco is very cute though.|@caseywedge let's get him 👆|@bendyorke yoga festival??|Awww @christinaukulele|@lyss_13  HALF WOLF|@abbycotterill|@hustle__rose check out this cute pup|@snowyjp4life|@jadelydia|@amanda.lee.stewart 😍😍😍 oh man so much cuteness!!!|@aperture_alley|I NEED HIM!!! @matteson14|@lauderballs 😩|@wildswanbird 😍🐺|@bhooghe2|@noeln that's a pretty good reason 🐶🐶🐶|@travisburrow26 :)|@yungjonesy|@ldrumm8  For sure!|@stelliottt|@tessaffelstein|@brrrianne it's blizzard|@yogilona could you please elaborate? I know his father (the wolf was a rescue. I believe he was found as a pup in Wyoming and couldn't be reintroduced into the wild) and Taco now lives in a town with 60 people surrounded by national forest so he gets plenty of time of outdoor time. It seems to be done right by all the animals involved.|Sure.  Although my reasoning might get a bit wordy... It is great that he has a lot of land and I understand a wolf imprinting on its rehabbers. With the right owner a hybrid like that can lead a happy life and if that is the case then Taco is lucky.  He is beautiful and he looks well taken care of!  But... The issue is the *active breeding of hybrids.  I mean I'm one person but I do have some experience with this as I come from a sanctuary standpoint- I was a behaviorist and a keeper and cared for wolves and many hybrid species that were not as lucky as Taco.  While a responsible owner can take excellent care of any animal it's the fact that it shouldn't happen to begin with.  There are no real mechanisms in place to regulate the breeding of wild species with domesticated animals it's can go wrong quickly.  It promotes the capture of wild animals for breeding purposes and it promotes a pet trade that is primarily negative (sadly). From a genetic standpoint also a lot can go wrong quickly including the evolution of species-specific diseases and mutations.  It's one opinion... But I've seen a lot of animals effected negatively and a lot euthanized due to irresponsible breeding and ownership.  It creates a demand for wolves to be acquired as stud-animals... Many end up on the wrong end of the pet trade. 😔 it also creates a demand for animals that many people are not prepared-or educated enough-to own.  Wolves and wolf hybrids are nothing like dogs and require a specialized diet (their caloric intake on a daily basis can be massive) exercise routine much more space and serious training (both obedience and behavioral). I hope my reasoning makes sense.  That's not to say Taco looks mistreated he seems like a very happy little pup and good for his parents.  They aren't easy little guys to take care of.  Unfortunately most people AREN'T as responsible as his owners are.  @sashajuliard|@yogilona interesting. Thank you for your input. All I can say is from personal experience and Taco seems to have an ideal situation. Thousands of acres as a backyard caring active owners a husky as a big brother (dog in the big). Unfortunately most of the things you describe are not exclusive to wild breed hybrids. There will always be poor dog owners and many pure bred dogs have genetic issues as well. I think what it comes down to tho is can your situation give the life your dog deserves purebred mix or wild hybrid.|Sooooo cute!!!!|@vxluu @angelloopy|@patrick_luu aww so cute|@6lake woof!|Does taco live in Hawaii? Be careful with advertising he is half wolf and lives in Hawaii. Government found out about a friend of mine and her pup and took the pup to be tested.

922,,,Sebastian Labbé does it right. This surfer created a wine that promotes exactly what many of us strive for:  #balance. “Just like winemaking surfing has been my way to connect with nature. Being surrounded by a fluid element teaches you humility to take care of the natural resources and to enjoy the ride of life. In front of the immensity of the oceans we are all just human. It inspires me and reminds me of simple things in life.” We’re so excited to try Wave Series Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir at #Wanderlust2015. 🍷🏄💛,balance wanderlust2015,|❤️|@errban93|@robisonjack|@huertas_a_deo|@sebastianlabbe|Sweet@sebastianlabbe|@nlglazer balance 👍|@lindamelelm ha ha sounds awesome!,603
