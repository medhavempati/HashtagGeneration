1,,,"Photo by @roshni.lodhia. Meet Naronyo NangРђЎoiho. As part of a TNC-coordinated grassland management program he's ensuring his community complies with their new grazing plan that will ensure healthy pasture for both livestock and wildlife in northern Tanzania. РђюItРђЎs true cows are our livelihood. In the past we had grass so even the wildlife were close by. These days itРђЎs different. The dry season lasts much longer. In 2016 so many of our cows died. It broke my heart but I had no control over it. The other challenge is that when cows graze in one area repeatedly it leads to barren lands. My hope is that this program will help us return the grasslands to how they used to be. When the grasslands improve everything improves: The wildlife increases and the cows get big enough to sell which means we can educate our children and have food on our plates.РђЮ Asante sana to Naronyo and all partners making this important effort possible: Northern Tanzania Rangelands Initiative Mara Training Centre Ujamaa Community Resource Team Dierenartsen Zonder Grenzen and @africanpeoplewildlife.

Staying in school means these girls typically marry and start having children at a later age and education provides women more opportunities to become employed earn an income and reduce their overall reliance on natural resources.

For generations the Hadza Рђћ one of AfricaРђЎs last hunter-gatherer tribes Рђћ has lived off the land roaming across open savannas and through unbroken forests bows in hand. They watch for wildlife among the grasses. They climb giant baobab trees in search of prized honeycombs. And each day they return to camp to share their bounty. РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ
For years the tribe had been watching their ancestral territory disappear. With the vanishing land came the threat of a vanishing culture the loss of a proud identity. The future looked bleak. But the Hadza tribe is writing a new story shaping a sustainable future for the land a rich legacy for their children. РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ
This story is made possible thanks to the vision and efforts of the many committed partners in the Northern Tanzania Rangelands Initiative (NTRI) Рђћ a collaboration of 10 organizations that TNC helped launch in 2014. With assistance from the Ujamaa Community Resource Team the Hadza secured legal rights over their remaining forested areas Рђћ the first traditional use agreement of its kind. РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ
Building on this historic achievement the patient work of many years the Hadza also collaborated with @carbontanzania the Dorobo Fund and TNC to establish a mechanism that pays the Hadza for protecting their forest. Over the past five years more than $250000 in carbon payments have gone to the Hadza for their conservation efforts. РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ
Tonight the HadzaРђЎs success and NTRIРђЎs collective efforts to support the sustainable future they envision is being celebrated on the world stage. Ezekiel Phillipo has traveled to NYC to accept the prestigious Equator Prize on behalf of the Hadza for a remarkable achievement: safeguarding 81000 acres of their homeland in TanzaniaРђЎs Yaeda Valley a way to protect the wild landscape they depend on and the traditional life they cherish.

РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ
During the school day she was tired and hungry. There was no time to cook before leaving her house and since she couldnРђЎt go home for lunch midday with the other students she spent her lunch hour reading. When she finally got home there were chores to do. If she could muster the energy sheРђЎd study by flashlight in her familyРђЎs small brick home.
РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ
Eventually Teresia began renting a room near school for just over $1 a month. She was spared the daily walk but still had to spend enormous amounts of time cooking gathering water and performing other chores. Still this kind of expense wasnРђЎt an option for everyone and Teresia considered herself lucky.
РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ
She had watched as her female classmates had dropped out of school: many quit to help their families work on their farms some got pregnant by men who interacted with girls living alone in rented rooms and some were discouraged to pursue their studies due to their gender. In fact the plunge in school attendance for girls here is precipitous: from 72% of 14-year-olds to just 10% of 18-year-olds.

The average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats has fallen by at least 20% mostly since 1900. More than 40% of amphibian species almost 33% of reef-forming corals and more than a third of all marine mammals are threatened. The report adds that one million species could be extinct within decades. It's time we find a more sustainable path. TNC scientists have run the numbers: this is possible if society makes big changes within the next decade. Our natural world is on life support.

Take ONE step today to learn more about how we can protect all living things in this beautiful complex web of life. Don't sit this one out. Be the VOICE for this planet. We all have the capacity to get engaged. Nature is resilient if we give it a chance and make it a priority. We can work together to protect endangered and threatened species so that extinction won't be humanityРђЎs most enduring legacy. Celebrate this magnificent planet we call home by giving her some LOVE. 
Here I am in a cloud forest in Chyulu Hills in Kenya hugging a centuries old fig tree. This cloud forest provides water for 4 million people on the coast of Kenya. All around the world forests like these cleanse the air sequester carbon and make our world beautiful. A just released study shows that we need to keep 50% of the world's lands in its natural state to prevent dangerous warming and ecosystems unraveling as reported by @natgeo. Investing and supporting the indigenous communities who live in these areas is one of the most effective means of protecting them. And if we could plant 1.2 trillion trees it would cancel out a decade of emissions. So let's celebrate the Earth today by embracing the forests we have and growing the ones we don't. Hug a tree.

We are your family."" I learned quickly that she was a joyous hardworking woman who chose her words wisely. She would wake up before sunrise to milk the cows. By 7:30 am she would be ready to tend to her farm. Her 11-year-old son would follow her helping her weed or simply giving her company. She would pat his head and say РђюWe are best friends. He keeps me company when he doesn't have school.РђЮ In the evenings IreneРђЎs young son and I would sit in the lantern-lit room of her kitchen listening to her tell stories as she cooked spinach and rice over a fire for dinner. She would tell us about how she has managed to grow and sell squash and capsicums how there were more than 11 different types of greens in the meal she was making and how she was the one who started digging up the dirt for a water pan with support from the Nairobi Water Fund. After seeing IreneРђЎs dedication her husband was inspired and joined her. Occasionally Irene would laugh at her own recollections.

Indigenous communities are on the front lines of the fight against poaching and landscape destruction making them the best protectors of the endangered wildlife around them. Adnan spends 12 hours every day watching over the vulnerable baby rhinos. If you went back 50 years this is where one of the densest populations of black rhinos lived but today most people living here have never seen a rhino in their life despite it being the most perfect habitat for them. In two generations this animal was poached almost to extinction.

The collars are carefully fitted to maximize the lionРђЎs comfort. With over 200 collars having been placed and 20 years of research there has been no sign of injury or negative impact. On the contrary a collar can save a lionРђЎs life. Satellite collars help groups like @lionlandscapes track the movements of lions living amongst people and livestock. Real-time movement data from these collars teaches us about how lions survive in human-dominated landscapes and helps us to prevent human-lion conflict by keeping livestock away from known lion locations. And if a collared lion approaches a livestock enclosure outfitted with an alarm the alarm will blare scaring the lion away. With less human-wildlife conflict all species benefit.

By monitoring lion movements closely the Lion Rangers are able to preempt human-carnivore conflict by warning livestock owners of the lionsРђЎ whereabouts and shadowing lions when they move into areas with high risk of conflict. They also serve as ambassadors for wildlife educating and supporting local livestock owners in conservation initiatives. @lionlandscapes is currently trying to raise funding to support 40 rangers which would be enough to cover 400000 acres of land that supports wildlife people and livestock in Laikipia by the end of 2019. TheyРђЎre hoping to expand even further the following year.

62,,,"Photo by @amivitale. A lion looks up from his freshly caught wild prey at @loisaba_conservancy in Laikipia northern Kenya. Large wide ranging carnivores like lions are normally one of the first mammal species to be lost in areas shared with people and livestock. Their presence in a human dominated landscape like this one is a symbol of a successful coexistence. Apex predators like lions play a vital role in maintaining a healthy balance in an ecosystem impacting everything below them from soil nutrients and disease to plant prey and scavenger populations. If lions are doing well then the entire ecosystem is likely doing well. In the long term that means the ecosystem will be better able to support the people that also rely on it.

Lion conservation is facing huge challenges and no one organisation can solve them alone. Vital partnerships like these make the huge undertaking of saving these magnificent creatures possible.

Leah welcomed me the photographer into her home as if I were a family member. Just moments later there was a rush of footsteps behind me. Her grandchildren had come to see her and Leah greeted them with joy and laughter. Come to think of it she was smiling or laughing throughout my stay there. We walked outside where she shared her story. After her husband died a man from Arusha city tried to take away her land. At the time she wasn't aware of her inheritance rights. But with the help of Ujamaa Community Resource Team a founding partner of the Northern Tanzania Rangelands Initiative she was able to get her land back. Leah spoke up as a Maasai woman which is not an easy task in her community. Leah explained how she is now a leader and a source of light for other women in her community: ""When people see me now they respect me for who I am. They seek advice from me.""

He is a Beach Management Unit (BMU) officer for Kashagulu Village in Kigoma a forest scout leader and a member of the Community Conservation Banks (COCOBAs). HeРђЎs highly trained and has been very supportive of conservation initiatives for his community. I spent the night in his village south of Mahale Mountains National Park and had the pleasure of speaking with him about his experience with the Tuungane Project. Raphael told me that around 1985 seine nets were first introduced to the fishermen on Lake Tanganyika. Before that fishermen were using lines and hooks which were much less destructive to fish populations. In this village and many like it the Tuungane Project has helped the fishing community to understand how destructive practices like using fine gauge nets (which remove even the smallest juvenile fish) beach seining and fishing within spawning and nursery areas endanger the fishermen's livelihoods and the village's economy and source of food. Raphael said that the BMU is important because ""the fish are here for us so when they increase it's good for us forever."" He's right and it's also good for the ecology of the lake showing the integral link between conservation and local communities.

I was able to spend some time with him at the Buhingu field office and observe him leading a seminar on climate smart agriculture. Each of the 16 villages involved in the Tuungane Project sent two representatives to be trained. Afterwards these two people were tasked with returning to their village to help train others. The morning session was in the classroom where the students learned how they would be making calculations and collect data. In the afternoon they trekked out to the field to learn how to take measurements and calculate plot size and slope angle.

The central part of the Greater Mahale Ecosystem is Mahale Mountain National Park which is protected by @tanzania_national_parks. But the forested mountains surrounding the park are equally important for the long-term survival of chimpanzees as it provides a critical buffer for the national park additional habitat and preserves migratory corridors through which chimpanzees can move. These corridors are vital for preserving genetic exchange and prevention of isolation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations. From the beach on Lake Tanganyika I hiked for about an hour into the verdant forests to reach the community of chimps photographed here. It was amazing to observe them at such close range but itРђЎs important to follow the rules of @tanzania_national_parks as they are very much wild animals.

Tuungane Kiswahili for ""let's unite"" is a multidisciplinary project that is working to protect the area around the Mahale Mountains. The project uses a 360-degree approach that addresses the interconnected objectives of conserving Lake Tanganyika the terrestrial environment and improving the lives of the local communities. By promoting sustainable behaviors such as sustainable fisheries practices climate smart agriculture family planning services and education and prevention of deforestation local communities are learning how to protect the resources on which they depend and becoming good stewards of their land.

Quick heads up that IРђЎll be taking over the @nature_africa Instagram account very soon to share photos from my recent solo three month expedition paddling and bicycling across the Great Lakes region of Lake Malawi Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria Рђћ so please keep an eye out for that. In the meantime hereРђЎs a bit about chimps in honor of the first ever World Chimpanzee Day today: The Mahale Mountains are home to the largest population of chimpanzees in Tanzania. The central part of the Greater Mahale Ecosystem is Mahale Mountain National Park which is protected by @TANAPA. But the forested mountains surrounding the park are equally important for the long term survival of chimpanzees as it provides a critical buffer for the national park additional habitat and preserves migratory corridors through which chimpanzees can move. These corridors are vital for preserving genetic exchange and prevention of isolation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations. Protecting habitat around the national park is where @nature_africa and @pathfinderintРђЎs Tuungane Project is making a huge difference. The forested areas of the Greater Mahale Ecosystem are under threat from agricultural expansion and illegal forest harvesting for charcoal production. Eight new Village Land Use Plans earmark 228000 acres as village forest reserves to protect key chimp habitat and 37 forest scouts from local communities have been trained and deployed.

Asante sana for your tireless efforts to #SaveElephants Dame Daphne. РЮц№ИЈ #Regram from @dswt: РђюРђўIt is all very raw but I must share with you the passing of my incredible mother Daphne Sheldrick. What an example she was to us all and I feel blessed to have been able to call her my Mum because she was quite simply Рђўone of a kindРђЎ. She was a national treasure and a conservation icon. Daphne passed away yesterday evening Thursday 12th April after a long battle with breast cancer a battle she finally lost. Her legacy is immeasurable and her passing will reverberate far and wide because the difference she has made for conservation in Kenya is unparalleled.

She will be sorely missed but never forgotten and this is what Daphne drew the most comfort from in her final weeks; knowing that her memory and work would continue with the tiny steps of baby elephants for generations to come and that the work that she pioneered has been able to achieve so much for wildlife and wild places throughout Kenya. She died knowing that she will continue to make a difference each and every day upon a land that she held so dear to her heart through the work of The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust thanks to a dedicated team she leaves behind. Daphne was fortunate to live long enough to preside over mud baths at Ithumba with well over 100 orphans ex orphans and wild friends frolicking and be able to say to herself Рђўbut for IРђЎ. What a gift she leaves us all with as she really is a shining example of the finest of humanity. Thank you all for your love and passion and support.РђЎ

Misamba Community Liaison Prudence Mwanza shares РђюAt first it was difficult for people to understand the value of conservation. But now they do. They understand that we have to stop poaching so that we can have more animals. More wildlife will generate more income so that we can have what we want such as buildings and schools. We learned from TNC that we should allow villagers to participate in meetings. ItРђЎs not the Village Action GroupРђЎs job to tell everyone what to do with the money [earned from tourism]. Instead we can all come up with one idea that the community is happy with.

A trainee undertakes a fire practical drill during an annual training course led by @nature_africa and @nature_arkansas in Zambia to teach people from government safari lodges and communities how to manage fire so that the park is healthier and can sustain more wildlife. Kafue employs an early season burning initiative supported by The Nature Conservancy. This not only attracts animals and birds for easier access to insects and new green grass shoots but also prevents late season uncontrolled wildfires that ruin valuable wildlife habitat which is very important for tourism. Tourists bring millions of kwacha (the state currency) into the national and local economies provide employment and raise Zambia's global reputation.

#Regram from @olpejeta photo by @andrewhbrown: РђюIt is with great sadness that Ol Pejeta Conservancy and the Dv┼»r Kr├Аlov├Е Zoo announce that Sudan the worldРђЎs last male northern white rhino age 45 died at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya on March 19th 2018 (yesterday). Sudan was being treated for age-related complications that led to degenerative changes in muscles and bones combined with extensive skin wounds. His condition worsened significantly in the last 24 hours; he was unable to stand up and was suffering a great deal. The veterinary team from the Dv┼»r Kr├Аlov├Е Zoo Ol Pejeta and Kenya Wildlife Service made the decision to euthanize him.

Sudan will be remembered for his unusually memorable life. In the 1970s he escaped extinction of his kind in the wild when he was moved to Dv┼»r Kr├Аlov├Е Zoo. Throughout his existence he significantly contributed to survival of his species as he sired two females. Additionally his genetic material was collected yesterday and provides a hope for future attempts at reproduction of northern white rhinos through advanced cellular technologies. During his final years Sudan came back to Africa and stole the heart of many with his dignity and strength. РђўWe on Ol Pejeta are all saddened by SudanРђЎs death. He was a great ambassador for his species and will be remembered for the work he did to raise awareness globally of the plight facing not only rhinos but also the many thousands of other species facing extinction as a result of unsustainable human activity. One day his demise will hopefully be seen as a seminal moment for conservationists world wideРђЎ said Richard Vigne Ol PejetaРђЎs CEO.

Unfortunately SudanРђЎs death leaves just two female northern white rhinos on the planet; his daughter Najin and her daughter Fatu who remain at Ol Pejeta. The only hope for the preservation of this subspecies now lies in developing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) techniques using eggs from the two remaining females stored northern white rhino semen from males and surrogate southern white rhino females.РђЮ",regram,|­Ъўћ­Ъўћ|) ':|I am often so sad at what humans have done to this world.

But with the help of UCRT (Ujamaa Community Resource Trust) she was able to get back her land. Leah spoke up as a Maasai woman- that is not an easy task in her community. Leah explained how she is now a leader- a source of light- for other women in her community. She said: ""when people see me now they respect me for who I am. They seek advice from me.""

128,,,"Photo by @tessrg14. When you think of Africa one of the first things that probably pops into your mind is the mighty lion. But lions are facing dire straits and have disappeared from over 90 percent of the wild lands they once roamed. A few of our teammates were recently meeting at @lewa_wildlife and had heard that there was a pride of lions out and about. We had to see them. After off-roading for a bit our safari guide Festus spotted the pride. He drove up close to them turned off the Land Cruiser and told us all to relax and enjoy. A lioness was basking in the sunshine with her cubs. They were beautiful. One of the cubs must have been feeling extra curious because he carefully snuck away from his brothers and sisters and walked toward us while mom was dozing off. He climbed up onto a tree about a meter or two away. Our hearts were racing. Mom woke up noticed that one of her little ones had gone for an adventure and was too close to us for comfort. She let out a call for her cub and when he didnРђЎt come back to her she walked right up past us pulled her baby out of the tree by the scruff of his neck and gave him a quick reprimanding followed by some love. These intimate moments remind us why we give it our all every day to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends. In honor of @worldwildlifeday the UN is asking everyone around the globe to do one thing to help protect these magnificent creatures. What will you do?

This small island nation sits off the coast of East Africa and is a stunning ecological paradise where youРђЎll find curious sea turtles giant tortoises and bleach-white fairy terns. But as the world changes so too will the challenges faced by its endangered and endemic species as well as the countryРђЎs 100000 residents who depend on their marine resources. Congrats to the citizens of Seychelles for making this big and bold step forward to protect this incredibly beautiful place. ItРђЎs wonderful to see this conservation commitment coming to life.

133,,,"Photo by Maggy Meyer. РђюMost of Tanzania has been experiencing drought for the last year and a lot of livestock have been dying. On a recent drive from Arusha to Randilen Community Wildlife Management Area (CWMA) I saw many cattle carcasses near the road. Other cows were still alive but were struggling to even stand on their feet. But as I entered Randilen I saw hundreds of healthy cattle. They were feeding in a large area of good grass that was preserved to use in times of drought. I immediately began to worry that all this pasture would be quickly depleted by a massive influx of cattle and there would be nothing left for the wildlife. But a village scout calmly told me: РђўWe have plenty of grass that can rescue the cattle and still support wildlife. In fact we are even hosting cattle from far away villages that are not part of our community.РђЎ During my day of meetings with community leaders the rains poured heavily. After the rain ended I began my journey home and was shocked to see the big herd of livestock exiting Randilen. The rain signaled to the herders that there would now be pasture in other places so they left RandilenРђЎs extreme drought refuge. If we can scale this behavior Рђћ if every community has a working Рђўextreme droughtРђЎ grazing area Рђћ then we will build resilient livestock and wildlife populations in northern Tanzania. I think that this is possible.РђЮ @marundaalphonce TNC Africa

134,,,"Photo by @roshni.lodhia. Home. Everyone in northern Tanzania defines it differently. For nomadic tribes it refers to wherever pasture is greenest or fruit is ripest. For a herd of elephants it is the ancient migration routes that cross village county and national borders Рђћ led by a matriarch and followed for generations. Here home isnРђЎt so much a place as a journey. And now the 8-million-acre landscape that has hosted these journeys for hundreds of years is becoming a jigsaw puzzle. Climate change rapidly expanding row-crop agriculture and population growth are shaping the pieces. At the same time TanzaniaРђЎs economic development depends on managing this landscape so that natural resources can continue to provide food and job security. The survival of elephants and traditional ways of life for indigenous people rests on ensuring they also have a say in this design. No single village Рђћ or organization Рђћ can tackle this alone. That is why we collaborate with nine partners in the Northern Tanzania Rangelands Initiative (NTRI) to help communities secure tenure over their traditional lands and apply good land management practices that benefit themselves and wildlife. Just as each puzzle piece in the landscape is unique so is the land tenure or resource rights solution that works best for each community. Communities now have new tools such as communal Certificates of Customary Rights of Occupancy (CCROs) and other innovative schemes that can address their specific needs and challenges. Together we are ensuring that indigenous communities have the knowledge technical support incentives and legal frameworks they need to keep their journeys alive.

135,,,"Photos by @jasonbhouston. The local person leading our work in Seychelles is soft-spoken marine biologist Helena Sims. РђюThis is what IРђЎve always wanted to do since I was 6 years old. My dad was a marine engineer and he also built his own boats. On weekends we would go fishing and sailing. My first dive was on my 10th birthday the minimum age to SCUBA. I went into a cave and there were sea fans everywhere. They look like bouquets of flowers Рђћ orange red and white. I was gobsmacked. I wanted to study marine biology in university but at that time the governmentРђЎs priorities for full scholarships were teaching or medicine. I had to make a case that this should be just as much a priority. They said yes but only if I earned perfect scores on the Cambridge International exams. I spent ages 16-17 preparing. I wanted it so badly. You have to wait four months to get your test results! My dad was the one to open the envelope. I was at sea on a study tour. He just said РђўYou did it!РђЎ and I started crying. I studied in Australia and came straight home once I graduated. I was recruited by @undp to conduct research to set priorities for the expansion of the marine protected area system of Seychelles. At first I didnРђЎt want to take on such a big job because my son had just been born and my father was very sick. He told me to go for it. It was his dream job and he was my idol. I did it for him. Some of our stakeholders have known me my whole life. They say РђўOh Helena Рђћ she wants to save everything.РђЎ But the zoning design has to work for everyone and thatРђЎs what TNC is committed to. As often as possible I go fishing and snorkeling with my son Kyan. [His name is derived from a word for the blue-green color of nearshore waters.] IРђЎm looking forward to telling him stories about his grandfather. He canРђЎt understand yet. HeРђЎs autistic and nonverbal but he has an infinite love for the ocean. Often when he was a baby the only way to calm him down was to put him in a bucket of water! For all Seychellois the sea is within us. ItРђЎs not only in our blood; itРђЎs our life.РђЮ ­ЪњЎ

136,,,"Photo by @ggkenya. Nothing like a hopeful story to help kick off the New Year. Рюе When the wildlife vet was unable to attend to a badly injured lioness Kaindu Village Scouts took matters into their own hands. What this injured lioness did was almost as remarkable as the village scoutsРђЎ actions to save her because moving towards human activity goes against every instinct of a weak or vulnerable wild animal. So itРђЎs as if she knew that crawling into the scoutsРђЎ camp was her last chance of help. The lioness had lost her front right paw to a poacherРђЎs snare. Once free she was unable to hunt desperately thin and battling infection. By chance or some sixth sense humans might never understand she sought refuge in the base camp of the scouts who protect and monitor wildlife in the 15000-hectare Kaindu Game Management Area (GMA) on the north-eastern flank of ZambiaРђЎs Kafue National Park. РђюWhen we first came across her she was finished. It was very sadРђЮ says Greenwell Kabinda of Kafue Natural Resources Trust. РђюWe felt like we had to help her.РђЮ Realizing straight away that she needed veterinary treatment Greenwell or РђюGreenРђЮ as heРђЎs known called the Zambian Department for Parks and Wildlife. However with limited resources and vast areas of ground to cover their vet was unable to come immediately. With nothing to lose the scouts set about finding her some meat which they placed near her in front of a motion-sensor camera in order to keep a watchful eye. РђюShe was very weak so that first night she only took a few bitesРђЮ says Green. РђюBut within a few days the whole carcass had gone.РђЮ The food gave her the strength to eventually go to the river for life-saving hydration. Soon a hopeful moment was caught on camera: She was joined by another lioness an adolescent cub and a large male Рђћ presumably members of her lost pride attracted by the smell of her dinner. To survive long-term in the wild she will need her pride to defend her and to share the prey they catch.

144,,,"Photo by @amivitale. Climate change is a complex problem that belongs to everyone everywhere. But there are stories from around the world that give us hope for the future. Like the grasslands of northern Kenya for example. The annual rains have followed a predicable rhythm for millennia. But disruptions to that rhythm brought on by climate change are threatening both wildlife and pastoralist communities as worsening cycles of drought create greater competition for grass. One way local community conservancies are addressing this issue is by managing grasslands to maintain wildlife habitat while also enabling sustainable livestock grazing. Our close partner @nrt_kenya then purchases cattle from conservancies that have implemented rigorous sustainable grazing plans with the help of impact investment funds raised by TNC. This model gives herders access to more lucrative mobile markets and directs some of the income back to the community conservancies. These healthier better-managed grasslands also sequester more carbon from the atmosphere. Click the link in our bio for more.

As part of our partnership with @nrt_kenya weРђЎre working to make changes in rangeland management to increase soil carbon leverage carbon markets and provide revenue for community rangeland trusts. In northern Kenya rangelands are managed mainly through the types of grazing animals the density at which they are grazed and the frequency by which they are rotated to other parts of the system to avoid overgrazing. These healthier better-managed grasslands sequester more carbon from the atmosphere provide better habitat for wildlife and better pasture for livestock.

In May of this year African Parks in collaboration with the RDB and with support from the Howard G. Buffett Foundation successfully reintroduced 18 Eastern black rhinos to Akagera in an historic translocation bringing back the species to the country after a 10-year absence. While all of the rhinos were considered precious cargo one in particular was carrying a special delivery. Ineza a female rhino turned out to be well into her 16-month gestation. Her new-born calf was confirmed in August and has been sighted regularly since then. We have spent the past six years preparing for this moment in making the park safe for the rhinos return and for all the wildlife in the park including the newborns along the way.

Four-legged rangers are an elephantРђЎs best friend and a secret weapon in the fight to #SaveElephants. TheyРђЎre needed because elephants are in crisis: An estimated 25000 are killed each year for their tusks to feed a global black market for ivory. Elephants move long distances every day and areas that are patrolled by different anti-poaching teams are enormous. When a poaching incident occurs the dogs can help recover the tusks and track down the poachers across long distances hours or even days after theyРђЎve left the scene. When poachers know that they are likely to get caught poaching rates go down. Here handler Alfred Langat trains @loisaba_conservancyРђЎs resident bloodhound Machine in Laikipia northern Kenya. National Dog Day is this coming Saturday and we need your help (and your pet's help too!) to rally support for these canine heroes. Learn more and take action at nature.org/rangerdogs. Link in bio.

It makes sense that existing information on animals and eclipses is largely anecdotal since most eclipse science is РђЊ and always has been РђЊ focused almost exclusively on the sky. While eclipse anecdotes may lack quantitative data they are enormously rich in keenly observed and documented details. In June 2001 astronomer Paul Murdin and about 250 volunteer naturalists set out to make concurrent field observations of African wildlife over Рђюthe three days centered on the eclipse.РђЮ For his assignment Murdin observed a pod of hippos living in Mana Pools National Park who tended to spend their days sleeping on a sandbar and their nights grazing on the river banks. On the day of the eclipse Murdin recorded as the light darkened the hippos Рђюstood and shifted and slipped into the riverРђЮ like they did every evening. But the totality only lasted three minutes and the sunlight returned before any of the animals had made it to the river bank. The hippos paused and Рђюlooked nervous.РђЮ Murdin thought they seemed uncertain as if they were confused by the disruption and recorded that they stayed in the river for the rest of the day Рђюeyes and ears alert above the surface.РђЮ Other observers in different parts of the park reported that as the eclipse darkened many birds stopped feeding and Рђюset off for their nests.РђЮ When the light returned to their feeding grounds so did they. However others showed no reaction to the eclipse and apparently went about their day unruffled and unconcerned. The baboons however were a slightly different story. As the eclipse progressed they Рђюstopped feedingРђЮ and observers speculated that they might be heading to their roosting sites. But as soon as sunlight returned they settled down right where they were and went back to whatever amounts to business as usual for baboons. Baboons Murdin noted are Рђюrather matter-of-fact.РђЮ Ready to go eclipse chasing? Visit bit.ly/notes-from-eclipses-past to find out how you can contribute to eclipse science.

169,,,"Photo by Thomas Vijayan. Today we shine a light on the mighty lion. The drought and grazing conflict in northern Kenya has been affecting everything: people cattle wildlife Рђћ and Livingstone the lion. Despite having lived in northern Loisaba (@loisaba_conservancy) for 15 years his pride moved to new territory in March. We know this because Livingstone is under surveillance. Local partners Ewaso Lions (@ewasolions) and Lion Landscapes fitted Livingstone with a GPS collar in January 2017 and heРђЎs been sharing his whereabouts with them ever since. This prideРђЎs recent move so far away from home is somewhat unprecedented. But as incidences of cattle invasions and habitat disturbance increased in Laikipia County this year many lion prides have been broken up and their ""normal"" home ranges have shifted. Clearly this is difficult on the lions and often leads to increased human-wildlife conflict as lions are jockeying for position and testing hierarchies within and between prides. But lions canРђЎt keep moving away from people forever. As human populations in any area increase so do occurrences of human-wildlife conflict. Collars on lions like Livingstone are helping us to learn more about their secret lives so we can better protect them and the people they live among in this quickly evolving landscape.

Hamisi Hassani and Palanjo Shububu members of the Hadza tribe stalk slowly through the high grass. Each man carries a bow strung with giraffe tendon arrows at the ready. Following Hadza hunters through the bush leaves me feeling like a rhinoceros trailing a panther. Their sandals made from pieces of old car tires donРђЎt make a sound while every one of my steps seems to snap a branch. They slip easily between thorny bushes that snag my clothes like fishhooks. Soon my socks are furry with burrs and IРђЎm dripping with sweat and gasping yet neither of the hunters seems the least bit winded.""

A recent training course in Zambia caught fire. ­ЪћЦ While it started off in a typical classroom this wasn't an ordinary class: It ended with all 30 students donning protective gear grabbing a drip torch and starting a few small fires. This TNC-led fire training course taught participants from government local communities and nearby tourist lodges fire management techniques that can help keep Zambia's Kafue National Park ecosystem healthy for increased wildlife and tourism.

Combating poaching is not an easy job. Rangers encounter carcasses of elephants that they have come to know. Elephants that they were trying to protect. ItРђЎs not a safe job. These brave men and women are often combating poachers who are heavily armed and highly motivated by the prospect of a hefty cash payout. But itРђЎs a rewarding job. Here ranger Kamara sleeps with three orphaned baby rhino calves at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (@lewa_wildlife) in northern Kenya.

173,,,"Photo by @amivitale. World Ranger Day is right around the corner on July 31 and weРђЎre shining a spotlight on a couple of our favorite elephant-saving rangers: anti-poaching dogs. Warrior and Machine are bloodhound brothers who live and work at @loisaba_conservancy in northern Kenya. They came to Loisaba from @oljogi where they were trained from a young age as sniffer dogs. Bloodhounds make great tracker dogs because they have more than 200 million olfactory cells (or ""scent receptors""). ThatРђЎs about 40 times as many as humans! Warrior is gentle and extremely accurate. Machine is very fast and a little afraid of animals but loves people. Visit nature.org/rangerdogs (link in bio) to learn more about these two canine heroes and find out how you can help give them everything theyРђЎll need for the year ahead including food medicine security gear and more.

Schoolchildren spill out of their classrooms and fly through the village for their morning jog. Mothers quickly wash their familiesРђЎ clothes in buckets at their feet with babies watching silently from their backs. Friends on motorbikes tear down the villageРђЎs main dirt path on their way to a wedding honking their horns in celebratory satisfaction.

177,,,"Photo by @ferodriguezfoto. In the United States fireworks help celebrate the Fourth of July. In Africa fireworks can #SaveElephants. Really! ItРђЎs a little after midnight on a Tuesday in June and a young bull elephant is foraging in near silence. There is no way for him to know that heРђЎs wandered out of the boundaries of Tarangire National Park and is currently munching on corn in a family farm. It doesnРђЎt take long before a bright flashing light appears in the distance followed by the screeching of an air horn. While these unfamiliar lights and loud noises are usually enough to get an elephant to leave this male seems unfazed. A few minutes later an object shoots through the air bursts open with a bang and a cloud of chili powder overtakes the elephantРђЎs senses. He quickly turns and disappears into the grassland. Why are these men throwing chili powder at elephants? In order to save their lives. As more and more people turn to farming in corridors where elephants range conflicts between the two cause huge problems. When an elephant wanders onto a villagerРђЎs farm it can have a devastating effect: A single elephant can destroy someoneРђЎs food supply for the entire year in one night trample property and threaten a familyРђЎs safety. In the past when an elephant made a wrong turn and ended up in a community garden a villager used the only defense he had against a five-ton animal: a spear. A direct hit was always enough to chase her away Рђд And make sure she would never come back. More than likely she retreated into the park before succumbing to her wounds after a few days. But these villagers now have a better Рђћ if slightly unorthodox Рђћ way to redirect elephants away from their crops. Honeyguide (@honeyguide_tz) with critical support from The Nature Conservancy (@nature_africa) has created a unique four-step elephant alarm system to protect a villagerРђЎs food source without harming the elephant.

It is distinguished from the plains zebra by its large fuzzy ears fine intricate stripes its gleaming white belly a soft brown muzzle and a charcoal dorsal stripe bordered by a white space at the rump. Hence the Samburu name for GrevyРђЎs zebra ""Loiborkurum"" meaning ""white-rumped"". I took this picture for the Zebra People project in collaboration with @grevyszebratrust.

Bao means 'board' or 'board game' in Swahili and can be a strategic and complex game that is usually played on a wooden board using hard seeds or nuts. In this case the Samburu warriors for the @grevyszebratrust I was photographing didn't have the board or seeds and inventively used sheep pellets and the Earth.

Lekureya one of the warriors was walking to camp late at night and stumbled upon a pack of hyenas chasing a Grevy's zebra and her one-week-old baby. In the commotion the mother ran away and escaped the hyenas but left her baby. Knowing the foal was certain to be eaten the warrior took her back to camp. The warriors then had a 24-hour window to try and reintroduce the foal back into a herd. If the plan failed РђЊ a very likely situation РђЊ she would have to be reared by humans until she was strong enough to survive. The next day the warriors missioned to find a herd for the baby. Amazingly they found the motherРђЎs tracks followed them found her and reintroduced the baby who immediately began suckling.

They were pushed to the brink of extinction as the illegal trade of horns and tusks soared from the late 1970s to early 1980s. At that time a group of people concerned about the plight of these animals formed @savetherhinonamibia and set out to stop the slaughter. Thanks to the strong joint efforts of SRT NamibiaРђЎs Ministry of Environment and Tourism law enforcement local communities and TNC the population has since rebounded and includes more than 200 today.

I want to deliver a message of hope and of urgency. The humpback was once endangered. It was so close to extinction that many said 'let it go.' But those who believe in the power of hope and action and policy wouldn't let up. The conservation community stood up for the humpback. Activists stood up for the humpback. Governments made changes. Politicians listened to their constituents. In summary people didn't give up. They fought. Today the humpback is on the rebound and in healthy numbers. This is where hope gets us. This is where action gets us. Don't give up. Forward friends. We can do it.

213,,,"#WhatsYourNature photo contest: ""The Zebra and the Oxpecker"" by @yswildlifephotography. ""Driving by herds of zebras I noticed the oxpeckers would settle on their backs but would fly away when they heard my car. I asked my driver to turn off the engine and we waited. Within a few minutes the oxpeckers returned and landed on the zebras' backs. I looked for a nice way to 'frame' the bird and found this: between two zebras. I love how the beak pops between the lines. I like to photograph common things like this oxpecker or a zebra and make them stand out in an unusual way."" Feeling inspired?

Fantastic piece in @forbes today from close partner and friend @nrt_kenyaРђЎs Mike Harrison: ""I remember talking to Jeremy Bastard the manager of a successful safari lodge in the remote Mathews mountains in northern Kenya. 'Ten years go no one cared about the elephants being injured or killed for their tusks' he said. 'The elephants were considered a nuisance. Herders spend many long hot hours digging wells to water their cattle and the elephants would come at night and destroy the wells in search of the same water. Now they always leave some in the trough for the elephants to share. Now because of community conservation they see value in those elephants their elephants.' To me this epitomizes the reason why curbing elephant poaching in north Kenya has not only been a conservation success but a social and economic success too. The proportion of illegally killed elephants in north Kenya's community lands has dropped 52% since 2012."" Click the link in our bio for more.

Guided by science. #Regram from @ggkenya: ""Today is 22 April World EARTH DAY ­ЪїЇ: Hanging out of an open-door chopper I shot this aerial of flamingoes flying low over Lake Logipi a shallow hot-spring fed soda lake in the Suguta Valley just south of Lake Turkana in the northern end of Kenya's Rift Valley. I get to go travel to some pretty amazing places in Africa and through my work I get to see and share with you what is really going on. 
Global warming is affecting the flamingoes mating season. Flamingos depend on the rainfall to help them mate without adequate rain they wonРђЎt engage in it. With global warming reducing the chances of rain in many areas often causing drought there will be a significant reduction of baby flamingoes in the years ahead. Global warming also dries out the lagoons lakes and swampy areas where flamingos live not only affecting their drinking water but changing the water salinity and causing the growth of a type of cyano-bacteria that is lethal to flamingoes at high dosages. In July - August 2004 at Lakes Manyara Big Momela and Embagai flamingoes were dying at a rate of 15-50 a day because of this. 
We can actively mitigate the effects of climate change on our precious wildlife and protect our wild spaces by supporting organisations like @nature_africa who understand and work hard to protect them.

The IUCN reports that the new designation was due to the giraffe's dramatic 40 percent decline since 1985. But luckily some researchers have been paying attention to the declining trends for the last decade or more and are poised to help increase the priority of conservation interventions for these gentle giants.

Today the cumulative results of all country level counts combined were released and there are reasons to be optimistic such as finding increasing numbers of elephants in ZambiaРђЎs Kafue National Park.

The main costs of #RangerDog units are their human ranger counterparts and the gear they need.

He also wears these cute little booties to help protect his feet from thorny acacias.

326,,,"MotherРђЎs Day is upon us ... Here's a special note from #SaveElephants Team Lead Misty Herrin to help get you ready for the big day: Elephant moms circle up around their babies when theyРђЎre worried. The herd keeps the little ones in the middle and each elephant faces outward keeping an eye out for threats. 
I just watched four young moms carefully tuck two babies behind a tree as we bounced noisily by on a rain-hammered road in Randilen Wildlife Management Area in Tanzania. One of the moms spread out her big beautiful ears to let us know she was on alert and eyed us intently. 
IРђЎm always moved by this sight and I canРђЎt help but think of the stories of entire families destroyed by poachers still circled around the babies to the end. 
The steadfastness of elephant moms aunts and sisters is one of the many reasons theyРђЎre so beloved. ThatРђЎs why we want to give you a small gift in thanks for your compassion for elephants: a free e-card (link in bio) to send someone special for MotherРђЎs Day. 
ThereРђЎs no creature more associated with motherly love than elephants so itРђЎs only appropriate to send a wonderful mom an elephant-sized hug this year. 
Thanks for your help to save elephant families like the one in Randilen. More than ever elephant moms need your help. They need more of us to circle up around their babies. // Photo by Michael North",saveelephants,|#mothersday #motherslove #momandbaby #elephant #elephantlove #savetheelephants #tanzania #africa #ig_africa #instagood #instamood|@betsybest|Wonderful picture! #saveelephants #educationisthekey #saynotoivory #ivoryisforelephants|36000 #elephants KILLED PER YEAR.

When we began working with Tencent to end the online ivory trade we knew there was no better way for the staff to understand the wildlife they were working tirelessly to protect than to see them in person. So last December six Tencent staff members two @tnc_china colleagues and four journalists embarked on a 10-day journey to Kenya to see wild elephants for the first time. Here they learned about our work with local partners to protect elephants an effort that goes hand-in-hand with their work to reduce the demand for ivory in China.

331,,,As Kenya prepares to burn its ivory stockpile this weekend we spotlight the reasons weРђЎre hopeful that we can #SaveElephants from a similar fate. Today itРђЎs all about the wildlife rangers who stand in the way of poachers and work tirelessly every day to protect the elephants we all love. Combating poaching is not an easy job. These rangers encounter carcasses of elephants that they have come to know. Elephants that they were trying to protect. ItРђЎs not a safe job. Rangers are often combating poachers who are heavily armed and highly motivated by the prospect of a hefty cash payout when the tusks are removed. But itРђЎs a rewarding job and weРђЎre working with local partners in Kenya Tanzania and Zambia to help train fund and equip them to patrol millions of square miles.

If you have a relative who is a poacher please tell them poaching is making our elephants disappear.РђЮ Over the weekend TNC President and CEO @marktercek presented a framed copy of her drawing to a member of TNC's China Board Mr. Zeng Fanzhi. He's the most famous artist in China and host of an upcoming exhibition and forum in Beijing that's designed to raise awareness of the wildlife trafficking crisis. Mr. Fanzhi was so moved by Dorisi and her story that he intends to include her drawing in the exhibition which will include works by famous artists from around the world. One of the goals of the #Elegram Project is to connect elephant supporters across boundaries. What better way to start the week than with this story about connecting Africa and China in such a lovely way. // Photo courtesy of @tnc_china,elegram elegram,"|#saveelephants #savetheelephants #loveelephants #iloveelephants #elephant #ivory #ivoryismean #oneconservancy #globalmovement #china #africa #happymonday #instagood|Great story!|This warms my heart! @laurenmagnante|This is wonderful|Wonderful!|#Elegram - making a difference!

Kamara a @lewa_wildlife rhino keeper introduces #Samburu warriors to baby #rhinos. None of the warriors had ever seen a rhino in the their life and some had never even seen a photo of a rhino. Their eyes got wide and they became very protective of them. The young warriors from Northern Rangelands Trust community conservancies have been visiting to learn about conservation practices such as sustainable land use grazing programs and endangered species conservation.

Much needed attention has been focused on the plight of wildlife but very little has been said about the indigenous communities on the frontlines of the poaching wars and the incredible work that is being done by @NRT_KENYA @lewa_wildlife and @NATURE_africa to strengthen them. These communities hold the key to saving Africa's great animals. The LEWA wildlife conservancy is a globally renowned conservation organization that acts as a catalyst and mode for conservation. The Northern Rangelands Trust works to develop resilient community conservancies which transform peopleРђЎs lives secure peace and conserve natural resources.

357,,,"Sending our deepest condolences to @lewa_wildlifeРђІ for the loss of Kilifi and many thanks to @amivitale for this heartfelt post. // #Regram from @amivitale: ""I've been silent this weekend struggling to share the news of the passing of Kilifi the two-year-old baby black rhino that wormed his way into all of our hearts. Kilifi was a great ambassador for all rhinos and taught us that man and wildlife can coexist in harmony. I can still hear his squeaky little voice as he followed Kamara and the other keepers around. I know every person at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (@lewa_wildlife) the Northern Rangelands Trust (@nrt_kenya) and most of all the committed keepers must have an unimaginable grief. Lewa announced that his death was caused by Clostridium perfringens a lethal bacteria that normally kills within four hours from the onset of signs. Kilifi died in the early morning leading to the conclusion that the infection had spread at night as the baby rhino slept. Despite the vet's greatest efforts the rhino succumbed to the effects of endotoxin. This infection is the first case ever recorded on Lewa. The staff there are currently giving the other three orphans antibiotics for short-term protection with plans to have annual polyvalent vaccines as a long-term deterrent. @natgeo @natgeocreative @thephotosociety @nikonusa #NRT #northernrangelandstrust #lewa #lewawildlife #savetherhinos #conservation #rhino #endangeredspecies #natureisspeaking #africa #kenya #magicalkenya #animals #safari #wildlife #photooftheday #photography #nature #seetheworld #bestdestinations #nikonnofilter #nofilter #nikon #d4s #nikonambassador #photojournalism #amivitale""",regram nrt northernrangelandstrust lewa lewawildlife savetherhinos conservation rhino endangeredspecies natureisspeaking africa kenya magicalkenya animals safari wildlife photooftheday photography nature seetheworld bestdestinations nikonnofilter nofilter nikon d4s nikonambassador photojournalism amivitale,|@neonwilde @lorenacarolinap|­Ъўћ­Ъњћ|­Ъњћ­Ъњћ­Ъњћ|@kedminsten77 =(((((((|@brookiesookie|­Ъњћ­ЪўфРЮц№ИЈ|Terrible news.

Then I received a letter saying: РђўStay away from elephants. We are going to kill you.РђЎ I challenged the leader of the poachers. I told him that the people owning the conservanciesРђћthe people being employedРђћare your brothers. You are fighting your brothers. These elephants brought these rangers that provide security. If we lose elephants we lose everything.

Reticulated giraffes are the most distinctively patterned of the eight subspecies of giraffe and they have the ability to thrive in the hot dry and semi-arid country. @loisaba_conservancy is an important conservation area for @nature_africa and partners because keeping it intact and healthy will secure many benefits for people and wildlife.,laikipia kenya,|#giraffe #reticulatedgiraffe #magicalkenya #africa #conservation #animals #magical #beauty #nature #seetheworld #bestdestinations #aerial #nikonnofilter #nofilter #nikon #d4 #nikonambassador #amivitale #photojournalism #onassignment @nature_africa @nature_org @natgeocreative @thephotosociety @nikonusa @natgeo|­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ|Well done @amivitale РГљ№ИЈ|@christianpaul morning!|@cesaralvarenga achoooooooou!|@theawesomeadventure|@easkewes hiii|@ajmedic626  Thought of you!|@fatimah_safi|@fatimah_safi|РЎЦ love|@maurilee18|@nicole_d91|@oldfashionedchocolate peek-a-boo|@nicole_d91 tall girls club|@joaquintartaglione|@artemaraos|Life @atrujillos97|@ymascaro ­ЪўЇ|@karencitanm Рў║№ИЈРў║№ИЈ|Wow|­Ъњџ|РЎЦ№ИЈРЎЦ№ИЈРЎЦ№ИЈРЎЦ№ИЈРЎЦ№ИЈ,835

The dog's Latin name means ""painted wolf"" referring to the animal's irregular mottled coat. They live in packs that are usually dominated by a monogamous breeding pair. These dogs are very social and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members.

386,,,Photo by @amivitale on assignment for @nature_africa. An elephant observes me as I photograph him at @loisaba_conservancy in #Laikipia northern #Kenya. Elephants are among the world's most intelligent species. They express a wide variety of behaviors including those associated with grief learning altruism use of tools compassion self-awareness memory and language. Researchers recently discovered that elephants can distinguish differences in human gender age and ethnicity purely by the sound of someoneРђЎs voice. If the voice belongs to a person who is more likely to pose a threat the elephants switch into defensive mode.

More than 800 #elephants spend significant time at @loisaba_conservancy and @nature_africa is working with partners to conserve this important #elephant migratory pathway. Elephants are excellent swimmers and if faced with a strong current they will use their trunk as a snorkel and then march right across rivers 12 feet deep. Long ago people thought that ancestral elephants may have come out of the seas. A popular myth was that their trunk evolved as a sort of snorkel in more aquatic settings.,laikipia kenya elephants elephant,|#saveelephants #magicalkenya #africa #conservation #animals #magical #beauty #safari #wildlife #photooftheday #photography #nature #seetheworld #bestdestinations #aerial #nikonnofilter #nofilter #nikon #d4 #nikonambassador #amivitale #photojournalism #onassignment @nature_africa @nature_org @natgeocreative @thephotosociety @nikonusa @natgeo|РЮц№ИЈ|Elephants the original norkelers! @sgagnon55|Cool!|­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ|Magnificent|@juanitapardor|­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ­ЪўЇ|Beautiful!|@shoultak1|@cheddathief I would like da baby for my birthday ­ЪЉИ|Fabulous|Hi im very interested in the work you do.

One of the inspiring rangers who is currently hand raising three baby #rhinos at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (@lewa_wildlife) in #Kenya. He spends 12 hours every day sometimes in pouring rain to watch over the vulnerable baby rhinos. He calls them his children and once had to fend off a lion who was eyeing one of the baby rhinos. Kamara has raised 10 baby rhinos 4 cheetahs 3 giraffes 3 warthogs 2 wild buffaloes 1 lion and 1 serval cat in his 10 years at Lewa. 
This is just one story among so many showing the incredible work of Kenyans who work so hard to protect the wildlife here. The #Lewa Wildlife Conservancy is the pioneer private rhino sanctuary in East #Africa established in 1983 to protect the last of #Kenya's black rhinos whose population had plummeted to near extinction.
I am working with these incredible conservancies to highlight the important work they are doing to protect the people and #wildlife of Kenya. Please support these rangers at @lewa_wildlifeand@NRT_KENYA

Kamara a @lewa_wildlife rhino keeper introduces #Samburu warriors to baby #rhinos. None of the warriors had ever seen a rhino in the their life and some had never even seen a photo of a rhino. Their eyes got wide and they became very protective of them. The young warriors from Northern Rangelands Trust community conservancies have been visiting to learn about conservation practices such as sustainable land use grazing programs and endangered species conservation. Much needed attention has been focused on the plight of wildlife but very little has been said about the indigenous communities on the frontlines of the poaching wars and the incredible work that is being done by @NRT_KENYA @lewa_wildlife and @NATURE_africa to strengthen them. These communities hold the key to saving Africa's great animals.
