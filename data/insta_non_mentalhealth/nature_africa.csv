1,,,"Photo by @roshni.lodhia. Meet Naronyo Nang’oiho. As part of a TNC-coordinated grassland management program he's ensuring his community complies with their new grazing plan that will ensure healthy pasture for both livestock and wildlife in northern Tanzania. “It’s true cows are our livelihood. In the past we had grass so even the wildlife were close by. These days it’s different. The dry season lasts much longer. In 2016 so many of our cows died. It broke my heart but I had no control over it. The other challenge is that when cows graze in one area repeatedly it leads to barren lands. My hope is that this program will help us return the grasslands to how they used to be. When the grasslands improve everything improves: The wildlife increases and the cows get big enough to sell which means we can educate our children and have food on our plates.” Asante sana to Naronyo and all partners making this important effort possible: Northern Tanzania Rangelands Initiative Mara Training Centre Ujamaa Community Resource Team Dierenartsen Zonder Grenzen and @africanpeoplewildlife.

Research shows that girls in western Tanzania who attended any amount of secondary school have about half as many children as other women. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Staying in school means these girls typically marry and start having children at a later age and education provides women more opportunities to become employed earn an income and reduce their overall reliance on natural resources. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
By educating girls we have a better chance of saving forests that are home to 93 percent of Tanzania’s chimpanzees and a lake that provides food and income for thousands of families. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Education can also make a big difference on the global scale: The Drawdown Project lists educating girls as the number 6 solution to climate change. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But for the 80 girls at Lagosa Secondary School who have a new dorm from a group of generous TNC donors the impact is immediate. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Now Teresia spends her afternoons hosting study groups with her fellow students. Her classmate Zainabu can study for more than one hour’s worth of flashlight batteries. And Magdalena no longer has to fear walking home in the dark. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This dorm is more than just a building: it’s safety it’s nourishment and it’s a plan for their future. And in the long term it’s a ray of hope for the resources everything — from the chimps swinging through the trees to the women collecting fresh water — depends on.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
These girls are thrilled! And there’s a little more time for you to help too. Check out ‪nature.org/educatingteresia‬ (link in bio). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Nestled in the space where private ranch lands to the south meet community rangelands to the north Kenya’s @loisaba_conservancy bridges these two worlds and is providing a model of how they can work together to benefit wildlife people and a sustainable nature-based economy.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Thanks to generous TNC supporters this 56000-acre wild gem was permanently protected in 2014. Since then it has become a hub for research and regional wildlife security and a source of practical knowledge and support for local communities including the 10.8-million-acres of community conservancies within @nrt_kenya.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Loisaba’s security team eliminated poaching on the property and the new mobile anti-poaching team based here serves 530000+ acres of community and private lands across this wildlife-rich region.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Applied research by partners on Loisaba’s lion leopard elephant and giraffe is informing conservation plans reducing human-wildlife conflict and promoting peaceful coexistence.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
New and updated ecotourism facilities promise to fund ongoing conservation of the property as well as community health education and development projects nearby.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And the Loisaba Conservation Center’s exhibits teach international guests and local school groups alike about wildlife food webs and the connection between conservation and local livelihoods.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Yet Loisaba’s story has just begun. Up next: reintroducing rhino!

5,,,"Photo by @nickhallphoto. For generations the Hadza — one of Africa’s last hunter-gatherer tribes — has lived off the land roaming across open savannas and through unbroken forests bows in hand. They watch for wildlife among the grasses. They climb giant baobab trees in search of prized honeycombs. And each day they return to camp to share their bounty. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
For years the tribe had been watching their ancestral territory disappear. With the vanishing land came the threat of a vanishing culture the loss of a proud identity. The future looked bleak. But the Hadza tribe is writing a new story shaping a sustainable future for the land a rich legacy for their children. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This story is made possible thanks to the vision and efforts of the many committed partners in the Northern Tanzania Rangelands Initiative (NTRI) — a collaboration of 10 organizations that TNC helped launch in 2014. With assistance from the Ujamaa Community Resource Team the Hadza secured legal rights over their remaining forested areas — the first traditional use agreement of its kind. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Building on this historic achievement the patient work of many years the Hadza also collaborated with @carbontanzania the Dorobo Fund and TNC to establish a mechanism that pays the Hadza for protecting their forest. Over the past five years more than $250000 in carbon payments have gone to the Hadza for their conservation efforts. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Tonight the Hadza’s success and NTRI’s collective efforts to support the sustainable future they envision is being celebrated on the world stage. Ezekiel Phillipo has traveled to NYC to accept the prestigious Equator Prize on behalf of the Hadza for a remarkable achievement: safeguarding 81000 acres of their homeland in Tanzania’s Yaeda Valley a way to protect the wild landscape they depend on and the traditional life they cherish. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

10,,,"Photo by @amivitale. Recent population monitoring by the “Twiga Walinzi” (Giraffe Guards) research team and systematic aerial surveys by @kenyawildlifeservice have been able to provide the first detailed population estimates of reticulated giraffe for the region. However relatively little is known about giraffe movements in these landscapes.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
That’s why we’re working with partners to fit reticulated giraffes with specially solar-powered GPS tracking devices to gain a better understanding of giraffe movements habitat usage and population dynamics in an effort to better protect them. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Data collected from 11 giraffes fitted in 2017 has already provided vital information about movement patterns as well as movement corridors and preferred areas of habitat. And an additional 28 giraffes were successfully ‘collared’ across northern Kenya just this past month including five at @loisaba_conservancy! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

11,,,"Photos by @roshni.lodhia. Teresia Gabriel lives about 8 miles from Lagosa Secondary School in western Tanzania. The road is long often muddy and treacherous. But Teresia like so many other young women persisted spending six or more hours a day walking back and forth to school in the pursuit of education. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
During the school day she was tired and hungry. There was no time to cook before leaving her house and since she couldn’t go home for lunch midday with the other students she spent her lunch hour reading. When she finally got home there were chores to do. If she could muster the energy she’d study by flashlight in her family’s small brick home.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Eventually Teresia began renting a room near school for just over $1 a month. She was spared the daily walk but still had to spend enormous amounts of time cooking gathering water and performing other chores. Still this kind of expense wasn’t an option for everyone and Teresia considered herself lucky.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
She had watched as her female classmates had dropped out of school: many quit to help their families work on their farms some got pregnant by men who interacted with girls living alone in rented rooms and some were discouraged to pursue their studies due to their gender. In fact the plunge in school attendance for girls here is precipitous: from 72% of 14-year-olds to just 10% of 18-year-olds.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Check out our story highlights to see how Teresia’s fortunes have changed. ❤️⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

33,,,"Photo by @amivitale. A young African elephant at @lewa_wildlife in northern Kenya. 🐘🌿 Yesterday the Intergovernmental Panel for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services released its first report detailing past biodiversity losses and prospects for people and nature. The average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats has fallen by at least 20% mostly since 1900. More than 40% of amphibian species almost 33% of reef-forming corals and more than a third of all marine mammals are threatened. The report adds that one million species could be extinct within decades. It's time we find a more sustainable path. TNC scientists have run the numbers: this is possible if society makes big changes within the next decade. Our natural world is on life support.

Take ONE step today to learn more about how we can protect all living things in this beautiful complex web of life. Don't sit this one out. Be the VOICE for this planet. We all have the capacity to get engaged. Nature is resilient if we give it a chance and make it a priority. We can work together to protect endangered and threatened species so that extinction won't be humanity’s most enduring legacy. Celebrate this magnificent planet we call home by giving her some LOVE. 
Here I am in a cloud forest in Chyulu Hills in Kenya hugging a centuries old fig tree. This cloud forest provides water for 4 million people on the coast of Kenya. All around the world forests like these cleanse the air sequester carbon and make our world beautiful. A just released study shows that we need to keep 50% of the world's lands in its natural state to prevent dangerous warming and ecosystems unraveling as reported by @natgeo. Investing and supporting the indigenous communities who live in these areas is one of the most effective means of protecting them. And if we could plant 1.2 trillion trees it would cancel out a decade of emissions. So let's celebrate the Earth today by embracing the forests we have and growing the ones we don't. Hug a tree. It will embrace you and the generations to come ten-fold.

Last night The Nature Conservancy's CEO Mark Tercek announced a bold idea at @ted: help countries address debt challenges while conserving 15% more of the world’s oceans. Put simply the idea is to restructure debt in island and coastal countries generating investments to protect reefs mangroves and fisheries. We’ve identified 20 nations where such a plan should be possible. If they get the support they need over the next 5 years they could protect 4 million square kilometers of our oceans.

Swipe left to see the orthomosaic image (a composite of hundreds of photographs) on which the model is based. These images were captured using a GPS-guided boat drone to help understand reef health and guide conservation initiatives. TNC is partnering with leaders in remote-sensing technologies to create a first-of-its-kind high definition map of the Caribbean’s coral reefs. Drone hyperspectral and satellite imagery provide three layers of coral reef data that are validated by scuba-diving scientists and will be used by TNC and partners to improve marine protected area design inform coral restoration and quantify the vital role reefs play in protecting coasts and communities. Tapping cutting-edge technology is just one way we are reimagining conservation to work “smarter” enabling our scientists and partners to act “faster” to advance action on a much “bigger” scale — here the size of the entire Caribbean Sea.

46,,,"Photo and words by @roshni.lodhia. We drove up and around bright green hills peppered with tea trees to get to Beatrice Manyua's tea plantation in Othaya Kenya. Why did we go there? To learn a bit more about the weight of water on female farmers. When it doesn't rain on time both her tea trees and food crops suffer. Beatrice was shy and soft spoken. She's a farmer and tea-picker: “On a good day I pick up to 30 kilograms of tea leaves per day” she said. Beatrice is one of many women farmers who has been encouraged by the Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund partners to excavate a large water pan — a method of harvesting water — to help maintain her tea and food crops all year round. Here's the full article aptly titled “The Weight of Water”: bit.ly/WomenAndWater (link in bio) 💙

As we drove in at 4:00 pm Irene was busy in her kitchen preparing chai and chapati (flat bread) for me. Even before I could unload my bags she handed me a hot cup of chai saying ""This is your home. We are your family."" I learned quickly that she was a joyous hardworking woman who chose her words wisely. She would wake up before sunrise to milk the cows. By 7:30 am she would be ready to tend to her farm. Her 11-year-old son would follow her helping her weed or simply giving her company. She would pat his head and say “We are best friends. He keeps me company when he doesn't have school.” In the evenings Irene’s young son and I would sit in the lantern-lit room of her kitchen listening to her tell stories as she cooked spinach and rice over a fire for dinner. She would tell us about how she has managed to grow and sell squash and capsicums how there were more than 11 different types of greens in the meal she was making and how she was the one who started digging up the dirt for a water pan with support from the Nairobi Water Fund. After seeing Irene’s dedication her husband was inspired and joined her. Occasionally Irene would laugh at her own recollections. She said “The life of a farmer is hard work so we must make sure we laugh and stay joyful.” 💕

Animals here receive dedicated constant care from their keepers who look after their health and help prepare them for life in the wild. Indigenous communities are on the front lines of the fight against poaching and landscape destruction making them the best protectors of the endangered wildlife around them. Adnan spends 12 hours every day watching over the vulnerable baby rhinos. If you went back 50 years this is where one of the densest populations of black rhinos lived but today most people living here have never seen a rhino in their life despite it being the most perfect habitat for them.

Real-time movement data from these collars teaches us about how lions survive in human-dominated landscapes and helps us to prevent human-lion conflict by keeping livestock away from known lion locations. And if a collared lion approaches a livestock enclosure outfitted with an alarm the alarm will blare scaring the lion away. With less human-wildlife conflict all species benefit.

In Laikipia livestock owners have found — and are finding new ways — to coexist with lions leopards hyenas and wild dogs. They are amazing for doing this. We owe them enormous gratitude for being so tolerant in the face of threats to their livelihoods and even their lives. @lionlandscapes works to support these livestock owners wherever possible. Among other undertakings @lionlandscapes rangers are trained to visit livestock enclosures spot practices that could make livestock vulnerable to lion attacks and help livestock owners better guard their livestock from lions.

By monitoring lion movements closely the Lion Rangers are able to preempt human-carnivore conflict by warning livestock owners of the lions’ whereabouts and shadowing lions when they move into areas with high risk of conflict. They also serve as ambassadors for wildlife educating and supporting local livestock owners in conservation initiatives. @lionlandscapes is currently trying to raise funding to support 40 rangers which would be enough to cover 400000 acres of land that supports wildlife people and livestock in Laikipia by the end of 2019.

62,,,"Photo by @amivitale. A lion looks up from his freshly caught wild prey at @loisaba_conservancy in Laikipia northern Kenya. Large wide ranging carnivores like lions are normally one of the first mammal species to be lost in areas shared with people and livestock. Their presence in a human dominated landscape like this one is a symbol of a successful coexistence. Apex predators like lions play a vital role in maintaining a healthy balance in an ecosystem impacting everything below them from soil nutrients and disease to plant prey and scavenger populations. If lions are doing well then the entire ecosystem is likely doing well. In the long term that means the ecosystem will be better able to support the people that also rely on it. 
To learn more follow @lionlandscapes @loisaba_conservancy @nature_africa @peregrinefund and @tusk_org who are working together to promote coexistence between humans and lions for the benefit of people and nature in northern Kenya.

Travelling down the bridled channels peacefully gliding along the water one’s senses are alert to every smell sound and sight on offer. It is vastly different to travelling by car boat or foot.

Leah welcomed me the photographer into her home as if I were a family member. Just moments later there was a rush of footsteps behind me. Her grandchildren had come to see her and Leah greeted them with joy and laughter. Come to think of it she was smiling or laughing throughout my stay there. We walked outside where she shared her story. After her husband died a man from Arusha city tried to take away her land. At the time she wasn't aware of her inheritance rights. But with the help of Ujamaa Community Resource Team a founding partner of the Northern Tanzania Rangelands Initiative she was able to get her land back. Leah spoke up as a Maasai woman which is not an easy task in her community. Leah explained how she is now a leader and a source of light for other women in her community: ""When people see me now they respect me for who I am. They seek advice from me.""

While we’re focused on securing forest habitat for endangered chimpanzees and creating sustainable fisheries on Lake Tanganyika they’re focused on improving the health of women and children by helping people plan their families. Yet we’re an integrated team with a shared vision of success. We’ve come far in the last six years. More than 35% of forest habitat and 12 fish breeding sites are now protected. Twelve health facilities have been renovated and 132 medical staff have been trained in emergency obstetric and newborn care. After more than half the families in a village became “model households” demonstrating positive health and sustainability behaviors we adjusted the measuring stick to create a “model village” that would advance progress across the entire ecosystem. On the last day of the project review we reported our progress to 25 visiting local government officials. Buhingu Ward Councilor Masoud Sibonja declared “My village is ready. We want to be a model village. We cannot wait any longer. Change is happening too fast. We are ready.” 🌿

That was the thought that ran into my mind as I travelled towards @loisaba_conservancy which lies in Laikipia. It seemed like we drove for miles without seeing any humans but well beyond our prying eyes were diverse communities: the local inhabitants who have been there for as long as time can tell and who play a key role in wildlife conservation. Often overlooked in the discussion of wildlife heritage and maintenance these communities work hard to keep harmony between themselves and nature. It was refreshing to learn from them on the work they have done with organizations like The Nature Conservancy in this area such as habitat maintenance grazing stability programs that protect both the livestock and wildlife education and health provision for the locals and economically empowering projects that allow everyone to earn off the land and its resources.” This World Tourism Day let’s all take blogger @akenyangirl’s advice and get out and explore.

Before that fishermen were using lines and hooks which were much less destructive to fish populations. In this village and many like it the Tuungane Project has helped the fishing community to understand how destructive practices like using fine gauge nets (which remove even the smallest juvenile fish) beach seining and fishing within spawning and nursery areas endanger the fishermen's livelihoods and the village's economy and source of food. Raphael said that the BMU is important because ""the fish are here for us so when they increase it's good for us forever."" He's right and it's also good for the ecology of the lake showing the integral link between conservation and local communities.

I was able to spend some time with him at the Buhingu field office and observe him leading a seminar on climate smart agriculture. Each of the 16 villages involved in the Tuungane Project sent two representatives to be trained. Afterwards these two people were tasked with returning to their village to help train others. The morning session was in the classroom where the students learned how they would be making calculations and collect data. In the afternoon they trekked out to the field to learn how to take measurements and calculate plot size and slope angle.

The central part of the Greater Mahale Ecosystem is Mahale Mountain National Park which is protected by @tanzania_national_parks. But the forested mountains surrounding the park are equally important for the long-term survival of chimpanzees as it provides a critical buffer for the national park additional habitat and preserves migratory corridors through which chimpanzees can move. These corridors are vital for preserving genetic exchange and prevention of isolation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations. From the beach on Lake Tanganyika I hiked for about an hour into the verdant forests to reach the community of chimps photographed here. It was amazing to observe them at such close range but it’s important to follow the rules of @tanzania_national_parks as they are very much wild animals.

Tuungane Kiswahili for ""let's unite"" is a multidisciplinary project that is working to protect the area around the Mahale Mountains. The project uses a 360-degree approach that addresses the interconnected objectives of conserving Lake Tanganyika the terrestrial environment and improving the lives of the local communities. By promoting sustainable behaviors such as sustainable fisheries practices climate smart agriculture family planning services and education and prevention of deforestation local communities are learning how to protect the resources on which they depend and becoming good stewards of their land.

Quick heads up that I’ll be taking over the @nature_africa Instagram account very soon to share photos from my recent solo three month expedition paddling and bicycling across the Great Lakes region of Lake Malawi Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria — so please keep an eye out for that. In the meantime here’s a bit about chimps in honor of the first ever World Chimpanzee Day today: The Mahale Mountains are home to the largest population of chimpanzees in Tanzania. The central part of the Greater Mahale Ecosystem is Mahale Mountain National Park which is protected by @TANAPA. But the forested mountains surrounding the park are equally important for the long term survival of chimpanzees as it provides a critical buffer for the national park additional habitat and preserves migratory corridors through which chimpanzees can move. These corridors are vital for preserving genetic exchange and prevention of isolation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations. Protecting habitat around the national park is where @nature_africa and @pathfinderint’s Tuungane Project is making a huge difference. The forested areas of the Greater Mahale Ecosystem are under threat from agricultural expansion and illegal forest harvesting for charcoal production. Eight new Village Land Use Plans earmark 228000 acres as village forest reserves to protect key chimp habitat and 37 forest scouts from local communities have been trained and deployed.

He’s an absolute gentleman loving his life and work out in the wild. Warrior and his brother Machine are two of Loisaba’s tracker dogs.

Part of their job is to also help the community solve crimes that happen in their area proving to be of immense value to everyone around them. When at the conservancy set aside some time to hang out with the security team and learn more about these awesome dogs and the team that works with them. Thanks to them the wildlife and people there are kept safe.

Our power team @bashir_munira @tatianakaranja and @akenyangirl had no problem settling into safari life at @loisaba_conservancy where they were visiting to take photos for the contest. It all began with a game drive to the Kiboko Star Beds and sundowners (thanks to @elewanacollection!) over a lovely sunset. You might be afraid of sleeping in open spaces outdoors – and who could blame you? But if you get the chance to visit Loisaba you have to try the Star Beds. The beds are set on wheels mkokoteni style making it easy to wheel them in and out of the deck area and under the open sky. With the great local weather you get the magical experience of watching stars twinkle invitingly above you. There’s no need to worry about security: the rooms are set almost at the edge of a cliff that’s hard to climb undetected. And there’s always security around the rooms day and night ensuring that you don’t come to harm. Feels like a bedroom with heaven as your sky and it’s amazing if you love stargazing. Even better the sunrise each morning.

One by one her grandchildren trickled in to greet her. The younger ones ran to her feet and the older ones bowed in front of her so she could pat their heads a sign of respect in the Maasai culture. Leah is a widow and a proud grandmother of 21 children (many of whom she supports). Like many Maasai women Leah wasn’t aware of her land rights. So after her husband died another man tried to take away her land. But with counsel from the Ujamaa Community Resource Team a founding partner of the Northern Tanzania Rangelands Initiative Leah learned about her land rights and fought back. Now she is a leader — a source of light — helping educate the women in her community about their rights. She says “When people see me now they respect me for who I am.

Her legacy is immeasurable and her passing will reverberate far and wide because the difference she has made for conservation in Kenya is unparalleled.

She will be sorely missed but never forgotten and this is what Daphne drew the most comfort from in her final weeks; knowing that her memory and work would continue with the tiny steps of baby elephants for generations to come and that the work that she pioneered has been able to achieve so much for wildlife and wild places throughout Kenya. She died knowing that she will continue to make a difference each and every day upon a land that she held so dear to her heart through the work of The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust thanks to a dedicated team she leaves behind. Daphne was fortunate to live long enough to preside over mud baths at Ithumba with well over 100 orphans ex orphans and wild friends frolicking and be able to say to herself ‘but for I’. What a gift she leaves us all with as she really is a shining example of the finest of humanity. Thank you all for your love and passion and support.’

They’re not hard to spot and they come in plenty. It was impossible to get bored of photographing them especially in areas yet to be burned still with long golden grass and copper leaves.

By increasing benefits to local people The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is turning neighbors into protectors. They are helping communities flanking the park secure a greater percentage of tourism income and are providing them with training in accounting meeting facilitation and strong collaborative governance. Misamba Community Liaison Prudence Mwanza shares “At first it was difficult for people to understand the value of conservation. But now they do. They understand that we have to stop poaching so that we can have more animals. More wildlife will generate more income so that we can have what we want such as buildings and schools. We learned from TNC that we should allow villagers to participate in meetings. It’s not the Village Action Group’s job to tell everyone what to do with the money [earned from tourism]. Instead we can all come up with one idea that the community is happy with. So far we have built a kitchen and bathrooms at a hospital refurbished a primary school and built a small pharmacy in a very remote village.” Wonderful to see!

#Regram from @olpejeta photo by @andrewhbrown: “It is with great sadness that Ol Pejeta Conservancy and the Dvůr Králové Zoo announce that Sudan the world’s last male northern white rhino age 45 died at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya on March 19th 2018 (yesterday). Sudan was being treated for age-related complications that led to degenerative changes in muscles and bones combined with extensive skin wounds. His condition worsened significantly in the last 24 hours; he was unable to stand up and was suffering a great deal. The veterinary team from the Dvůr Králové Zoo Ol Pejeta and Kenya Wildlife Service made the decision to euthanize him.

Sudan will be remembered for his unusually memorable life. In the 1970s he escaped extinction of his kind in the wild when he was moved to Dvůr Králové Zoo. Throughout his existence he significantly contributed to survival of his species as he sired two females. Additionally his genetic material was collected yesterday and provides a hope for future attempts at reproduction of northern white rhinos through advanced cellular technologies. During his final years Sudan came back to Africa and stole the heart of many with his dignity and strength. ‘We on Ol Pejeta are all saddened by Sudan’s death. He was a great ambassador for his species and will be remembered for the work he did to raise awareness globally of the plight facing not only rhinos but also the many thousands of other species facing extinction as a result of unsustainable human activity. One day his demise will hopefully be seen as a seminal moment for conservationists world wide’ said Richard Vigne Ol Pejeta’s CEO.

Unfortunately Sudan’s death leaves just two female northern white rhinos on the planet; his daughter Najin and her daughter Fatu who remain at Ol Pejeta. The only hope for the preservation of this subspecies now lies in developing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) techniques using eggs from the two remaining females stored northern white rhino semen from males and surrogate southern white rhino females.”",regram,|😔😔|) ':|I am often so sad at what humans have done to this world.

128,,,"Photo by @tessrg14. When you think of Africa one of the first things that probably pops into your mind is the mighty lion. But lions are facing dire straits and have disappeared from over 90 percent of the wild lands they once roamed. A few of our teammates were recently meeting at @lewa_wildlife and had heard that there was a pride of lions out and about. We had to see them. After off-roading for a bit our safari guide Festus spotted the pride. He drove up close to them turned off the Land Cruiser and told us all to relax and enjoy. A lioness was basking in the sunshine with her cubs. They were beautiful. One of the cubs must have been feeling extra curious because he carefully snuck away from his brothers and sisters and walked toward us while mom was dozing off. He climbed up onto a tree about a meter or two away. Our hearts were racing. Mom woke up noticed that one of her little ones had gone for an adventure and was too close to us for comfort. She let out a call for her cub and when he didn’t come back to her she walked right up past us pulled her baby out of the tree by the scruff of his neck and gave him a quick reprimanding followed by some love. These intimate moments remind us why we give it our all every day to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends. In honor of @worldwildlifeday the UN is asking everyone around the globe to do one thing to help protect these magnificent creatures. What will you do?

129,,,"Photo by @amivitale. Wood fuel is one of Africa’s most significant environmental and health threats but the level of public discourse on the issue doesn’t often reflect the size of the challenge. To try and tackle this we’re drawing out a roadmap for the future of Africa’s sustainable wood fuel consumption that includes planting billions of new trees and supporting innovative ways to convert wood into energy more efficiently. As Africa’s population industry and infrastructure continue to grow ensuring communities have the knowledge and tools to balance the well-being of their families with sustainable livelihoods and abundant natural resources will become increasingly critical. If we can empower women to plant trees in the corners of their farms and use wood fuel more efficiently we can enable local people to tackle one of Africa’s biggest health and environmental challenges in simple meaningful ways.

133,,,"Photo by Maggy Meyer. “Most of Tanzania has been experiencing drought for the last year and a lot of livestock have been dying. On a recent drive from Arusha to Randilen Community Wildlife Management Area (CWMA) I saw many cattle carcasses near the road. Other cows were still alive but were struggling to even stand on their feet. But as I entered Randilen I saw hundreds of healthy cattle. They were feeding in a large area of good grass that was preserved to use in times of drought. I immediately began to worry that all this pasture would be quickly depleted by a massive influx of cattle and there would be nothing left for the wildlife. But a village scout calmly told me: ‘We have plenty of grass that can rescue the cattle and still support wildlife. In fact we are even hosting cattle from far away villages that are not part of our community.’ During my day of meetings with community leaders the rains poured heavily. After the rain ended I began my journey home and was shocked to see the big herd of livestock exiting Randilen. The rain signaled to the herders that there would now be pasture in other places so they left Randilen’s extreme drought refuge. If we can scale this behavior — if every community has a working ‘extreme drought’ grazing area — then we will build resilient livestock and wildlife populations in northern Tanzania. I think that this is possible.” @marundaalphonce TNC Africa

134,,,"Photo by @roshni.lodhia. Home. Everyone in northern Tanzania defines it differently. For nomadic tribes it refers to wherever pasture is greenest or fruit is ripest. For a herd of elephants it is the ancient migration routes that cross village county and national borders — led by a matriarch and followed for generations. Here home isn’t so much a place as a journey. And now the 8-million-acre landscape that has hosted these journeys for hundreds of years is becoming a jigsaw puzzle. Climate change rapidly expanding row-crop agriculture and population growth are shaping the pieces. At the same time Tanzania’s economic development depends on managing this landscape so that natural resources can continue to provide food and job security. The survival of elephants and traditional ways of life for indigenous people rests on ensuring they also have a say in this design. No single village — or organization — can tackle this alone. That is why we collaborate with nine partners in the Northern Tanzania Rangelands Initiative (NTRI) to help communities secure tenure over their traditional lands and apply good land management practices that benefit themselves and wildlife. Just as each puzzle piece in the landscape is unique so is the land tenure or resource rights solution that works best for each community. Communities now have new tools such as communal Certificates of Customary Rights of Occupancy (CCROs) and other innovative schemes that can address their specific needs and challenges. Together we are ensuring that indigenous communities have the knowledge technical support incentives and legal frameworks they need to keep their journeys alive.

135,,,"Photos by @jasonbhouston. The local person leading our work in Seychelles is soft-spoken marine biologist Helena Sims. “This is what I’ve always wanted to do since I was 6 years old. My dad was a marine engineer and he also built his own boats. On weekends we would go fishing and sailing. My first dive was on my 10th birthday the minimum age to SCUBA. I went into a cave and there were sea fans everywhere. They look like bouquets of flowers — orange red and white. I was gobsmacked. I wanted to study marine biology in university but at that time the government’s priorities for full scholarships were teaching or medicine. I had to make a case that this should be just as much a priority. They said yes but only if I earned perfect scores on the Cambridge International exams. I spent ages 16-17 preparing. I wanted it so badly. You have to wait four months to get your test results! My dad was the one to open the envelope. I was at sea on a study tour. He just said ‘You did it!’ and I started crying. I studied in Australia and came straight home once I graduated. I was recruited by @undp to conduct research to set priorities for the expansion of the marine protected area system of Seychelles. At first I didn’t want to take on such a big job because my son had just been born and my father was very sick. He told me to go for it. It was his dream job and he was my idol. I did it for him. Some of our stakeholders have known me my whole life. They say ‘Oh Helena — she wants to save everything.’ But the zoning design has to work for everyone and that’s what TNC is committed to. As often as possible I go fishing and snorkeling with my son Kyan. [His name is derived from a word for the blue-green color of nearshore waters.] I’m looking forward to telling him stories about his grandfather. He can’t understand yet. He’s autistic and nonverbal but he has an infinite love for the ocean. Often when he was a baby the only way to calm him down was to put him in a bucket of water! For all Seychellois the sea is within us. It’s not only in our blood; it’s our life.” 💙

136,,,"Photo by @ggkenya. Nothing like a hopeful story to help kick off the New Year. ✨ When the wildlife vet was unable to attend to a badly injured lioness Kaindu Village Scouts took matters into their own hands. What this injured lioness did was almost as remarkable as the village scouts’ actions to save her because moving towards human activity goes against every instinct of a weak or vulnerable wild animal. So it’s as if she knew that crawling into the scouts’ camp was her last chance of help. The lioness had lost her front right paw to a poacher’s snare. Once free she was unable to hunt desperately thin and battling infection. By chance or some sixth sense humans might never understand she sought refuge in the base camp of the scouts who protect and monitor wildlife in the 15000-hectare Kaindu Game Management Area (GMA) on the north-eastern flank of Zambia’s Kafue National Park. “When we first came across her she was finished. It was very sad” says Greenwell Kabinda of Kafue Natural Resources Trust. “We felt like we had to help her.” Realizing straight away that she needed veterinary treatment Greenwell or “Green” as he’s known called the Zambian Department for Parks and Wildlife. However with limited resources and vast areas of ground to cover their vet was unable to come immediately. With nothing to lose the scouts set about finding her some meat which they placed near her in front of a motion-sensor camera in order to keep a watchful eye. “She was very weak so that first night she only took a few bites” says Green. “But within a few days the whole carcass had gone.” The food gave her the strength to eventually go to the river for life-saving hydration. Soon a hopeful moment was caught on camera: She was joined by another lioness an adolescent cub and a large male — presumably members of her lost pride attracted by the smell of her dinner. To survive long-term in the wild she will need her pride to defend her and to share the prey they catch.

These three recent rescues illustrate different pieces of the big complex picture of elephant conservation — beyond poaching. The stories show why we’re so focused on habitat protection and on creating conservation incentives for people who live among elephants. We hope you’ll take a moment now to read about these rescues that you helped make possible. And most importantly thank you for supporting our efforts to keep elephants out of trouble.

A dream team of five pastoralists known as Twiga Walinzi (“Giraffe Guards”) are using GPS data and a network of camera traps to catalogue individual giraffes across northern Kenya and better understand their threats and reactions to human development. Why? Because giraffe populations have crashed 40 percent since 1985. “When I was growing up there were a lot of giraffes in this area. Now there aren’t many” says Symon Masiaine leader of Twiga Walinzi. “We are gathering information that will help determine the most important strategies to reverse the decline of the giraffe population.” ✨🦒✨

In Lamu and Tana River counties the coral reefs mangroves swamps and indigenous forests are not only globally important areas for nature but provide food security and a source of income for local communities. Overfishing rising populations and the use of illegal and destructive fishing gear are putting increasing pressure on Lamu’s delicate marine ecosystem.

144,,,"Photo by @amivitale. Climate change is a complex problem that belongs to everyone everywhere. But there are stories from around the world that give us hope for the future. Like the grasslands of northern Kenya for example. The annual rains have followed a predicable rhythm for millennia. But disruptions to that rhythm brought on by climate change are threatening both wildlife and pastoralist communities as worsening cycles of drought create greater competition for grass. One way local community conservancies are addressing this issue is by managing grasslands to maintain wildlife habitat while also enabling sustainable livestock grazing. Our close partner @nrt_kenya then purchases cattle from conservancies that have implemented rigorous sustainable grazing plans with the help of impact investment funds raised by TNC. This model gives herders access to more lucrative mobile markets and directs some of the income back to the community conservancies. These healthier better-managed grasslands also sequester more carbon from the atmosphere. Click the link in our bio for more.

As part of our partnership with @nrt_kenya we’re working to make changes in rangeland management to increase soil carbon leverage carbon markets and provide revenue for community rangeland trusts. In northern Kenya rangelands are managed mainly through the types of grazing animals the density at which they are grazed and the frequency by which they are rotated to other parts of the system to avoid overgrazing. These healthier better-managed grasslands sequester more carbon from the atmosphere provide better habitat for wildlife and better pasture for livestock.

In May of this year African Parks in collaboration with the RDB and with support from the Howard G. Buffett Foundation successfully reintroduced 18 Eastern black rhinos to Akagera in an historic translocation bringing back the species to the country after a 10-year absence. While all of the rhinos were considered precious cargo one in particular was carrying a special delivery. Ineza a female rhino turned out to be well into her 16-month gestation. Her new-born calf was confirmed in August and has been sighted regularly since then. We have spent the past six years preparing for this moment in making the park safe for the rhinos return and for all the wildlife in the park including the newborns along the way.

Four-legged rangers are an elephant’s best friend and a secret weapon in the fight to #SaveElephants. They’re needed because elephants are in crisis: An estimated 25000 are killed each year for their tusks to feed a global black market for ivory. Elephants move long distances every day and areas that are patrolled by different anti-poaching teams are enormous. When a poaching incident occurs the dogs can help recover the tusks and track down the poachers across long distances hours or even days after they’ve left the scene. When poachers know that they are likely to get caught poaching rates go down. Here handler Alfred Langat trains @loisaba_conservancy’s resident bloodhound Machine in Laikipia northern Kenya. National Dog Day is this coming Saturday and we need your help (and your pet's help too!) to rally support for these canine heroes. Learn more and take action at nature.org/rangerdogs. Link in bio.

It makes sense that existing information on animals and eclipses is largely anecdotal since most eclipse science is – and always has been – focused almost exclusively on the sky. While eclipse anecdotes may lack quantitative data they are enormously rich in keenly observed and documented details. In June 2001 astronomer Paul Murdin and about 250 volunteer naturalists set out to make concurrent field observations of African wildlife over “the three days centered on the eclipse.” For his assignment Murdin observed a pod of hippos living in Mana Pools National Park who tended to spend their days sleeping on a sandbar and their nights grazing on the river banks. On the day of the eclipse Murdin recorded as the light darkened the hippos “stood and shifted and slipped into the river” like they did every evening. But the totality only lasted three minutes and the sunlight returned before any of the animals had made it to the river bank. The hippos paused and “looked nervous.” Murdin thought they seemed uncertain as if they were confused by the disruption and recorded that they stayed in the river for the rest of the day “eyes and ears alert above the surface.” Other observers in different parts of the park reported that as the eclipse darkened many birds stopped feeding and “set off for their nests.” When the light returned to their feeding grounds so did they. However others showed no reaction to the eclipse and apparently went about their day unruffled and unconcerned. The baboons however were a slightly different story. As the eclipse progressed they “stopped feeding” and observers speculated that they might be heading to their roosting sites. But as soon as sunlight returned they settled down right where they were and went back to whatever amounts to business as usual for baboons. Baboons Murdin noted are “rather matter-of-fact.” Ready to go eclipse chasing? Visit bit.ly/notes-from-eclipses-past to find out how you can contribute to eclipse science.

169,,,"Photo by Thomas Vijayan. Today we shine a light on the mighty lion. The drought and grazing conflict in northern Kenya has been affecting everything: people cattle wildlife — and Livingstone the lion. Despite having lived in northern Loisaba (@loisaba_conservancy) for 15 years his pride moved to new territory in March. We know this because Livingstone is under surveillance. Local partners Ewaso Lions (@ewasolions) and Lion Landscapes fitted Livingstone with a GPS collar in January 2017 and he’s been sharing his whereabouts with them ever since. This pride’s recent move so far away from home is somewhat unprecedented. But as incidences of cattle invasions and habitat disturbance increased in Laikipia County this year many lion prides have been broken up and their ""normal"" home ranges have shifted. Clearly this is difficult on the lions and often leads to increased human-wildlife conflict as lions are jockeying for position and testing hierarchies within and between prides. But lions can’t keep moving away from people forever. As human populations in any area increase so do occurrences of human-wildlife conflict. Collars on lions like Livingstone are helping us to learn more about their secret lives so we can better protect them and the people they live among in this quickly evolving landscape. You can be a part of this pilot project too: bit.ly/high-tech-lions (link in bio)

Hamisi Hassani and Palanjo Shububu members of the Hadza tribe stalk slowly through the high grass. Each man carries a bow strung with giraffe tendon arrows at the ready. Following Hadza hunters through the bush leaves me feeling like a rhinoceros trailing a panther. Their sandals made from pieces of old car tires don’t make a sound while every one of my steps seems to snap a branch. They slip easily between thorny bushes that snag my clothes like fishhooks. Soon my socks are furry with burrs and I’m dripping with sweat and gasping yet neither of the hunters seems the least bit winded.""

Combating poaching is not an easy job. Rangers encounter carcasses of elephants that they have come to know. Elephants that they were trying to protect. It’s not a safe job. These brave men and women are often combating poachers who are heavily armed and highly motivated by the prospect of a hefty cash payout. But it’s a rewarding job. Here ranger Kamara sleeps with three orphaned baby rhino calves at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (@lewa_wildlife) in northern Kenya.

173,,,"Photo by @amivitale. World Ranger Day is right around the corner on July 31 and we’re shining a spotlight on a couple of our favorite elephant-saving rangers: anti-poaching dogs. Warrior and Machine are bloodhound brothers who live and work at @loisaba_conservancy in northern Kenya. They came to Loisaba from @oljogi where they were trained from a young age as sniffer dogs. Bloodhounds make great tracker dogs because they have more than 200 million olfactory cells (or ""scent receptors""). That’s about 40 times as many as humans! Warrior is gentle and extremely accurate. Machine is very fast and a little afraid of animals but loves people. Visit nature.org/rangerdogs (link in bio) to learn more about these two canine heroes and find out how you can help give them everything they’ll need for the year ahead including food medicine security gear and more.

Women in colorful clothing hurry around a fishing boat as it arrives at dawn to scoop piles of silver sardines into their empty buckets. Schoolchildren spill out of their classrooms and fly through the village for their morning jog. Mothers quickly wash their families’ clothes in buckets at their feet with babies watching silently from their backs. Friends on motorbikes tear down the village’s main dirt path on their way to a wedding honking their horns in celebratory satisfaction. It’s with these bustling communities that TNC (@nature_africa) and health services organization Pathfinder International (@pathfinderint) launched the Tuungane Project. The project takes a 360-degree approach to tackle the interconnected challenges of population health and the environment to create healthier families fisheries and forests.

177,,,"Photo by @ferodriguezfoto. In the United States fireworks help celebrate the Fourth of July. In Africa fireworks can #SaveElephants. Really! It’s a little after midnight on a Tuesday in June and a young bull elephant is foraging in near silence. There is no way for him to know that he’s wandered out of the boundaries of Tarangire National Park and is currently munching on corn in a family farm. It doesn’t take long before a bright flashing light appears in the distance followed by the screeching of an air horn. While these unfamiliar lights and loud noises are usually enough to get an elephant to leave this male seems unfazed. A few minutes later an object shoots through the air bursts open with a bang and a cloud of chili powder overtakes the elephant’s senses. He quickly turns and disappears into the grassland. Why are these men throwing chili powder at elephants? In order to save their lives. As more and more people turn to farming in corridors where elephants range conflicts between the two cause huge problems. When an elephant wanders onto a villager’s farm it can have a devastating effect: A single elephant can destroy someone’s food supply for the entire year in one night trample property and threaten a family’s safety. In the past when an elephant made a wrong turn and ended up in a community garden a villager used the only defense he had against a five-ton animal: a spear. A direct hit was always enough to chase her away … And make sure she would never come back. More than likely she retreated into the park before succumbing to her wounds after a few days. But these villagers now have a better — if slightly unorthodox — way to redirect elephants away from their crops. Honeyguide (@honeyguide_tz) with critical support from The Nature Conservancy (@nature_africa) has created a unique four-step elephant alarm system to protect a villager’s food source without harming the elephant.

187,,,"Photo by @mia_collis. The Grevy’s zebra is the largest zebra in Africa and also one of the most endangered. There are an estimated 2800 remaining in the world. It is distinguished from the plains zebra by its large fuzzy ears fine intricate stripes its gleaming white belly a soft brown muzzle and a charcoal dorsal stripe bordered by a white space at the rump. Hence the Samburu name for Grevy’s zebra ""Loiborkurum"" meaning ""white-rumped"". I took this picture for the Zebra People project in collaboration with @grevyszebratrust.

In this case the Samburu warriors for the @grevyszebratrust I was photographing didn't have the board or seeds and inventively used sheep pellets and the Earth.

189,,,"Photo by @mia_collis. On the last day of a five-day walk with the Zebra Warriors from @grevyszebratrust on a remote plateau of northern Kenya this little zebra turned up! Lekureya one of the warriors was walking to camp late at night and stumbled upon a pack of hyenas chasing a Grevy's zebra and her one-week-old baby. In the commotion the mother ran away and escaped the hyenas but left her baby. Knowing the foal was certain to be eaten the warrior took her back to camp. The warriors then had a 24-hour window to try and reintroduce the foal back into a herd. If the plan failed – a very likely situation – she would have to be reared by humans until she was strong enough to survive. The next day the warriors missioned to find a herd for the baby. Amazingly they found the mother’s tracks followed them found her and reintroduced the baby who immediately began suckling.

200,,,"Photo by Johan Swanepoel. ""We have to stand together or we will lose them forever."" Rampant poaching once took a heavy toll on the Kunene region’s black rhino. They were pushed to the brink of extinction as the illegal trade of horns and tusks soared from the late 1970s to early 1980s. At that time a group of people concerned about the plight of these animals formed @savetherhinonamibia and set out to stop the slaughter. Thanks to the strong joint efforts of SRT Namibia’s Ministry of Environment and Tourism law enforcement local communities and TNC the population has since rebounded and includes more than 200 today.

A new car is exciting for anyone but for the members of this conservancy it was cause for a big celebration. Narupa women donned colorful kanga and head-to-toe beads to sing children from the Kipsing Secondary School performed dances and many conservancy board members and other guests gave heartfelt speeches about the importance of conservation. At the end of the ceremony the uniformed rangers stood at attention as two new ribbon-adorned land cruisers — provided by @nrt_kenya with funding from @nature_africa — approached the group.

223,,,"Photo by @amivitale. Fantastic piece in @forbes today from close partner and friend @nrt_kenya’s Mike Harrison: ""I remember talking to Jeremy Bastard the manager of a successful safari lodge in the remote Mathews mountains in northern Kenya. 'Ten years go no one cared about the elephants being injured or killed for their tusks' he said. 'The elephants were considered a nuisance. Herders spend many long hot hours digging wells to water their cattle and the elephants would come at night and destroy the wells in search of the same water. Now they always leave some in the trough for the elephants to share. Now because of community conservation they see value in those elephants their elephants.' To me this epitomizes the reason why curbing elephant poaching in north Kenya has not only been a conservation success but a social and economic success too. The proportion of illegally killed elephants in north Kenya's community lands has dropped 52% since 2012."" Click the link in our bio for more.

225,,,"Let’s make every day Earth Day. United by nature. Guided by science. #Regram from @ggkenya: ""Today is 22 April World EARTH DAY 🌍: Hanging out of an open-door chopper I shot this aerial of flamingoes flying low over Lake Logipi a shallow hot-spring fed soda lake in the Suguta Valley just south of Lake Turkana in the northern end of Kenya's Rift Valley. I get to go travel to some pretty amazing places in Africa and through my work I get to see and share with you what is really going on. 
Global warming is affecting the flamingoes mating season. Flamingos depend on the rainfall to help them mate without adequate rain they won’t engage in it. With global warming reducing the chances of rain in many areas often causing drought there will be a significant reduction of baby flamingoes in the years ahead. Global warming also dries out the lagoons lakes and swampy areas where flamingos live not only affecting their drinking water but changing the water salinity and causing the growth of a type of cyano-bacteria that is lethal to flamingoes at high dosages. In July - August 2004 at Lakes Manyara Big Momela and Embagai flamingoes were dying at a rate of 15-50 a day because of this. 
We can actively mitigate the effects of climate change on our precious wildlife and protect our wild spaces by supporting organisations like @nature_africa who understand and work hard to protect them.

255,,,"Photo by @amivitale. Everywhere Africa is on the move. Our continent is home to some of the globe’s fastest growing economies. With this rise comes the need for more food jobs clean water and energy. Nature has sustained Africans for millennia but the population will double to 2.4 billion within 40 years. Maps of our children’s future are being drawn now: blueprints for dams highways pipelines railroads and plantations. We have a window of opportunity to work together to shape these maps. We can avoid mistakes made elsewhere in the world and in doing so inspire and educate nations that are struggling to revive nature where it was needlessly lost. We can prove that sustainable and equitable development is possible. At The Nature Conservancy we believe that nature can endure as nations blossom. We believe that because of our dedicated partners and supporters and because of children whose eyes light up at the wonder of their spectacular wildlife that is the envy of the world. With each rising of the mighty African sun let us go further and faster — together — toward our shared dreams for our precious natural resources and the wild places that call to us and that we call home.

We look forward to teaming up with you in 2017 and following your adventures every step of the way. // #Regram from @jamessuter: ""2016 has been an incredible year for our team @blackbeanproductions. When we first starting telling stories that we believe created much needed awareness around the plight of wildlife in Africa and the complexities that make up the conservation world – we filmed them when we had time if we were lucky if we found the budget. We pressed on through so many ups and downs – we carried on because we saw the impact that sharing these stories had – not only on the world around us but on the people we made the stories about. You cannot put this into words - making people feel valued and that their job their daily tasks are important and are seen. However not in our wildest dreams did we expect for these ‘side stories’ to grow into what they have done today. We are thankful for every one of you that has supported us in this journey sent us on incredible shoots and inspired us through your own good work. We believe that by working together and supporting teams on the ground that are already doing excellent work within communities in Africa and in conservation that we can all be a part of a making a real difference. If we support these teams we can allow them to expand upon what they are doing. We produce both documentary and commercial film but our underlying goal is that all our products have real heart. We are so passionate about what we do and look forward to working with you in 2017. We have some exciting projects underway and will be keeping you all up to date. Enjoy this fun clip that you gives you a glimpse into what goes on behind-the-scenes on our shoots and allows you to get to know our awesome crew a bit better. The Instagram community has played such a huge role - enabling us to meet people and forge relationships across borders. Working together with a shared vision we can achieve so much. Thank you for all your support and for working with us. If we don't take a stand to protect the wildlife around us it will only be a matter of time before we lose the animals that we share the earth with.""",regram,|Keep up the great work😊|Thank you @nature_africa looking forward to 2017 and collaborating with you|👏🏻❤️👏🏻❤️👏🏻❤️|Thank you!!|Love this ❤️❤️🙏|Awesome!

According to our friend and colleague Pete McIntyre of the University of Wisconsin-Madison ""Lakes and rivers are naturally productive. Someone can go out on the river and catch a meal. That is an amazing thing. But those fisheries need to be sustainably managed. The numerous threats facing them and their habitat need to be addressed. In addition to the value of rivers for recreation agriculture transportation and industry we have to recognize they’re also vitally important to the well-being of many people around the world.""

As they pull they shake off the fish that are clinging to the net back into the water. Eventually when there is only a few feet of net left in the water the fish can be rolled in a large bundle onto the top of the boat. The villages are part of @nature_africa and @pathfinderint’s Tuungane Project which empowers them to protect the lake from overfishing. @nature_africa provides science education and practical tools to ensure the long-term sustainability of their aquatic resources.

Today the cumulative results of all country level counts combined were released and there are reasons to be optimistic such as finding increasing numbers of elephants in Zambia’s Kafue National Park.

304,,,You may be wondering … Why aren’t there more #RangerDogs? The challenge as ever is getting sufficient resources. The main costs of #RangerDog units are their human ranger counterparts and the gear they need.

313,,,Friends – we’d like to introduce you to two very special #RangerDogs Warrior and Machine who live and work at @loisaba_conservancy protecting people and wildlife against poaching and crimes. These bloodhound brothers are four years old and came from @oljogi where they were trained from a young age as sniffer dogs. Bloodhounds make great tracker dogs because they have more than 200 million olfactory cells (“scent receptors”) which is about 40 times as many as humans! Warrior and Machine are well trained and well loved by their handlers: Joseph Ekaran Christopher Lengini and Ryan Nangunye. Keep an eye out for more fun facts about these two canine heroes — and Ranger Dog Zack from @nrt_kenya — throughout the rest of the week. p.s. You can help support these awesome dogs!

326,,,"Mother’s Day is upon us ... Here's a special note from #SaveElephants Team Lead Misty Herrin to help get you ready for the big day: Elephant moms circle up around their babies when they’re worried. The herd keeps the little ones in the middle and each elephant faces outward keeping an eye out for threats. 
I just watched four young moms carefully tuck two babies behind a tree as we bounced noisily by on a rain-hammered road in Randilen Wildlife Management Area in Tanzania. One of the moms spread out her big beautiful ears to let us know she was on alert and eyed us intently. 
I’m always moved by this sight and I can’t help but think of the stories of entire families destroyed by poachers still circled around the babies to the end. 
The steadfastness of elephant moms aunts and sisters is one of the many reasons they’re so beloved. That’s why we want to give you a small gift in thanks for your compassion for elephants: a free e-card (link in bio) to send someone special for Mother’s Day. 
There’s no creature more associated with motherly love than elephants so it’s only appropriate to send a wonderful mom an elephant-sized hug this year. 
Thanks for your help to save elephant families like the one in Randilen. More than ever elephant moms need your help. They need more of us to circle up around their babies. // Photo by Michael North",saveelephants,|#mothersday #motherslove #momandbaby #elephant #elephantlove #savetheelephants #tanzania #africa #ig_africa #instagood #instamood|@betsybest|Wonderful picture! #saveelephants #educationisthekey #saynotoivory #ivoryisforelephants|36000 #elephants KILLED PER YEAR.

330,,,"As Kenya prepares to burn its ivory stockpile this weekend we spotlight stories that give us hope that we can #SaveElephants from a similar fate. Today’s post is about how we’re working with Internet company Tencent to reduce the demand for ivory in China. 
When we began working with Tencent to end the online ivory trade we knew there was no better way for the staff to understand the wildlife they were working tirelessly to protect than to see them in person. So last December six Tencent staff members two @tnc_china colleagues and four journalists embarked on a 10-day journey to Kenya to see wild elephants for the first time. Here they learned about our work with local partners to protect elephants an effort that goes hand-in-hand with their work to reduce the demand for ivory in China.

331,,,As Kenya prepares to burn its ivory stockpile this weekend we spotlight the reasons we’re hopeful that we can #SaveElephants from a similar fate. Today it’s all about the wildlife rangers who stand in the way of poachers and work tirelessly every day to protect the elephants we all love. Combating poaching is not an easy job. These rangers encounter carcasses of elephants that they have come to know. Elephants that they were trying to protect. It’s not a safe job. Rangers are often combating poachers who are heavily armed and highly motivated by the prospect of a hefty cash payout when the tusks are removed. But it’s a rewarding job and we’re working with local partners in Kenya Tanzania and Zambia to help train fund and equip them to patrol millions of square miles.

340,,,Very special #15SecondSafari with @jamessuter coming your way! This time James and his team caught rare white lions on camera in South Africa: “We tracked a ‘super pride’ of almost 40 lions that I had come to know years back when I was a Game Ranger in Kruger National Park. It was especially moving because it is an area that I know well and have walked many times - so to hear that two white lions had naturally occurred here was amazing. Almost unbelievable. Especially since there has not been a white lion sighting in the KNP for decades and they are thought to be indigenous to the Timbavati area.” Click the link in our bio to view the full video from @jamessuter and @blackbeanproductions.,15secondsafari,"|#whitelions #savelions #lion #cub #wildlife #wildplaces #nature #conservation #shortfilmshowcase #krugernationalpark #southafrica #africa #ig_africa #instagood

342,,,“Small islands have big ideas.” This week in Paris we’re sharing a big idea to help Seychelles a small nation of 115 islands in the Western Indian Ocean about 1000 miles off the coast of East Africa and north of Madagascar finance ocean conservation and climate adaptation. Seychelles’ “Blue Economy” is based on tuna and tourism which along with its low-lying island geography makes its people and economy particularly vulnerable to the threats of climate change. That’s why we’re working with the Seychelles government and partners to help increase marine protection from less than 1% to 30% of its territorial waters. Great to see Seychelles leading the way for other island countries at #COP21!

347,,,Hi friends – you may remember a very moving story that we shared with you recently about a little girl named Dorisi who spoke up at an #elegram-making event at her school in Tanzania saying: “My fellow children when we go home let us tell our parents uncles and relatives to help stop poaching. If you have a relative who is a poacher please tell them poaching is making our elephants disappear.” Over the weekend TNC President and CEO @marktercek presented a framed copy of her drawing to a member of TNC's China Board Mr. Zeng Fanzhi. He's the most famous artist in China and host of an upcoming exhibition and forum in Beijing that's designed to raise awareness of the wildlife trafficking crisis. Mr. Fanzhi was so moved by Dorisi and her story that he intends to include her drawing in the exhibition which will include works by famous artists from around the world. One of the goals of the #Elegram Project is to connect elephant supporters across boundaries. What better way to start the week than with this story about connecting Africa and China in such a lovely way. // Photo courtesy of @tnc_china,elegram elegram,"|#saveelephants #savetheelephants #loveelephants #iloveelephants #elephant #ivory #ivoryismean #oneconservancy #globalmovement #china #africa #happymonday #instagood|Great story!|This warms my heart! @laurenmagnante|This is wonderful|Wonderful!|#Elegram - making a difference!

Adumu and aigus are Maa verbs meaning ""to jump"" with adumu meaning ""to jump up and down in dance"". This is what is seen here and is popular to photograph - quite amazing how high they can jump.

354,,,"Celebrating World Tourism Day with the launch of #15SecondSafari! Get ready to be transported to Africa where tourism is key to conserving nature. 
This first post is from the one and only @jamessuter: “Is it not amazing watching these stars 'move' across the night sky? We know that Earth is not the center of the universe – let alone the Solar System – but looking at the sky it’s easy to get confused. There is something about staring into the sky in a place like this (middle of the Serengeti) that is more than just amazing – it’s actually moving. When we are children we are so easily in awe of so much – big and small because we are seeing things for the first time. I think we should all be in awe of things like this every time we are able to experience them – and in this case it's being able to see so many stars in the night sky. This timelapse was shot at @singita_. Explore this incredible mobile tented camp that follows the Great Migration in Tanzania. And yes – we do try capture it but nothing beats being there and the real thing.”",15secondsafari,"|#worldtourismday #tourism #travel #serengeti #tanzania #africa #nature #conservation #beautiful #nightsky #astronomy #timelapse #instagood #instamood

355,,,"One of our favorite rhino stories of all time in honor of #WorldRhinoDay ❤️ #Regram from @amivitale: “Photo by @amivitale. Kamara a @lewa_wildlife rhino keeper introduces #Samburu warriors to baby #rhinos. None of the warriors had ever seen a rhino in the their life and some had never even seen a photo of a rhino. Their eyes got wide and they became very protective of them. The young warriors from Northern Rangelands Trust community conservancies have been visiting to learn about conservation practices such as sustainable land use grazing programs and endangered species conservation.

Much needed attention has been focused on the plight of wildlife but very little has been said about the indigenous communities on the frontlines of the poaching wars and the incredible work that is being done by @NRT_KENYA @lewa_wildlife and @NATURE_africa to strengthen them. These communities hold the key to saving Africa's great animals. The LEWA wildlife conservancy is a globally renowned conservation organization that acts as a catalyst and mode for conservation. The Northern Rangelands Trust works to develop resilient community conservancies which transform people’s lives secure peace and conserve natural resources.

357,,,"Sending our deepest condolences to @lewa_wildlife​ for the loss of Kilifi and many thanks to @amivitale for this heartfelt post. // #Regram from @amivitale: ""I've been silent this weekend struggling to share the news of the passing of Kilifi the two-year-old baby black rhino that wormed his way into all of our hearts. Kilifi was a great ambassador for all rhinos and taught us that man and wildlife can coexist in harmony. I can still hear his squeaky little voice as he followed Kamara and the other keepers around. I know every person at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (@lewa_wildlife) the Northern Rangelands Trust (@nrt_kenya) and most of all the committed keepers must have an unimaginable grief. Lewa announced that his death was caused by Clostridium perfringens a lethal bacteria that normally kills within four hours from the onset of signs. Kilifi died in the early morning leading to the conclusion that the infection had spread at night as the baby rhino slept. Despite the vet's greatest efforts the rhino succumbed to the effects of endotoxin. This infection is the first case ever recorded on Lewa. The staff there are currently giving the other three orphans antibiotics for short-term protection with plans to have annual polyvalent vaccines as a long-term deterrent. @natgeo @natgeocreative @thephotosociety @nikonusa #NRT #northernrangelandstrust #lewa #lewawildlife #savetherhinos #conservation #rhino #endangeredspecies #natureisspeaking #africa #kenya #magicalkenya #animals #safari #wildlife #photooftheday #photography #nature #seetheworld #bestdestinations #nikonnofilter #nofilter #nikon #d4s #nikonambassador #photojournalism #amivitale""",regram nrt northernrangelandstrust lewa lewawildlife savetherhinos conservation rhino endangeredspecies natureisspeaking africa kenya magicalkenya animals safari wildlife photooftheday photography nature seetheworld bestdestinations nikonnofilter nofilter nikon d4s nikonambassador photojournalism amivitale,|@neonwilde @lorenacarolinap|😔💔|💔💔💔|@kedminsten77 =(((((((|@brookiesookie|💔😪❤️|Terrible news.

358,,,Get ready to fall in love with elephants all over again. Our team in Zambia recently sent a photo of an elephant they spied standing in a river. She lost half of her trunk likely to a snare set by poachers. But she’s beautiful and appears healthy. And local people have seen young elephants feeding her – putting foliage in her mouth – since she can’t pull branches from trees anymore. Elephants are known for caring for their sick like this. But they need our help too. This #WorldElephantDay we hope that this tough girl and her caring herd will inspire you to take action. She can’t trumpet anymore so we have to do it for her. Please consider making an #elegram in her honor. We’re so close to reaching our goal of collecting 20000 handmade elephants!

367,,,Josephine Ekiru put her life on the line to help #SaveElephants and it was worth it! Here’s what she had to say about standing up to poachers in her community in Kenya: “My passion became educating people on the importance of wildlife and how poaching hurts our communities. Then I received a letter saying: ‘Stay away from elephants. We are going to kill you.’ I challenged the leader of the poachers. I told him that the people owning the conservancies—the people being employed—are your brothers. You are fighting your brothers. These elephants brought these rangers that provide security. If we lose elephants we lose everything. I convinced him—and now I have convinced all of the poachers in our area.” // Photo by @amivitale,saveelephants,|#HERdPower #girlpower #whoruntheworld #savetheelephants #loveelephants #iloveelephants #elephant #worldelephantday #ivory #poaching #saynotoivory #ivoryismean #wildlife #kenya #africa|🙌🏽 thank you thank you ❤️❤️❤️ @seleste39|Wonderful!|#Brave|<3|Purpose great job Josephine|This is such an inspiring story.

Elephants are among the world's most intelligent species. They express a wide variety of behaviors including those associated with grief learning altruism use of tools compassion self-awareness memory and language. Researchers recently discovered that elephants can distinguish differences in human gender age and ethnicity purely by the sound of someone’s voice. If the voice belongs to a person who is more likely to pose a threat the elephants switch into defensive mode.

387,,,Photo by @amivitale on assignment for @nature_africa. A herd of elephants cross a river at @loisaba_conservancy in #Laikipia northern #Kenya. More than 800 #elephants spend significant time at @loisaba_conservancy and @nature_africa is working with partners to conserve this important #elephant migratory pathway. Elephants are excellent swimmers and if faced with a strong current they will use their trunk as a snorkel and then march right across rivers 12 feet deep. Long ago people thought that ancestral elephants may have come out of the seas. A popular myth was that their trunk evolved as a sort of snorkel in more aquatic settings.,laikipia kenya elephants elephant,|#saveelephants #magicalkenya #africa #conservation #animals #magical #beauty #safari #wildlife #photooftheday #photography #nature #seetheworld #bestdestinations #aerial #nikonnofilter #nofilter #nikon #d4 #nikonambassador #amivitale #photojournalism #onassignment @nature_africa @nature_org @natgeocreative @thephotosociety @nikonusa @natgeo|❤️|Elephants the original norkelers! @sgagnon55|Cool!|😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍|Magnificent|@juanitapardor|😍😍😍|Beautiful!|@shoultak1|@cheddathief I would like da baby for my birthday 👸|Fabulous|Hi im very interested in the work you do.

424,,,"💛💙💜💚❤️// #Regram from @amivitale: “Photo by @amivitale. Meet Kamara. One of the inspiring rangers who is currently hand raising three baby #rhinos at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (@lewa_wildlife) in #Kenya. He spends 12 hours every day sometimes in pouring rain to watch over the vulnerable baby rhinos. He calls them his children and once had to fend off a lion who was eyeing one of the baby rhinos. Kamara has raised 10 baby rhinos 4 cheetahs 3 giraffes 3 warthogs 2 wild buffaloes 1 lion and 1 serval cat in his 10 years at Lewa. 
This is just one story among so many showing the incredible work of Kenyans who work so hard to protect the wildlife here. The #Lewa Wildlife Conservancy is the pioneer private rhino sanctuary in East #Africa established in 1983 to protect the last of #Kenya's black rhinos whose population had plummeted to near extinction.
I am working with these incredible conservancies to highlight the important work they are doing to protect the people and #wildlife of Kenya. Please support these rangers at @lewa_wildlifeand@NRT_KENYA

I have a deep respect for this land but witnessing the intensity of those lions so closely and hearing the haunting sounds of that poor warthog is humbling. I will never walk through this landscape in the same way. 
#OlPejeta is East Africa’s Largest Black Rhino Sanctuary the only place in Kenya to see chimpanzees and it holds some of the highest predator densities in Kenya. They have more than 60 lions! They also have 32 wild dogs and 3 of the last Northern White Rhinos alive on the planet. I'm here for the month working on the powerful stories these conservancies and groups like @olpejeta @NRT_KENYA @lewa_wildlife @NATURE_africa & @nature_org are doing to help the people and the wildlife of Kenya. #incredible #Kenya.

432,,,"Heartwarming story from magical Kenya. It’s all about community conservancies. Proud to work with you @lewa_wildlife & @nrt_kenya. // #Regram from @NatGeo: “Photo by @amivitale. Kamara a @lewa_wildlife rhino keeper introduces #Samburu warriors to baby #rhinos. None of the warriors had ever seen a rhino in the their life and some had never even seen a photo of a rhino. Their eyes got wide and they became very protective of them. The young warriors from Northern Rangelands Trust community conservancies have been visiting to learn about conservation practices such as sustainable land use grazing programs and endangered species conservation. Much needed attention has been focused on the plight of wildlife but very little has been said about the indigenous communities on the frontlines of the poaching wars and the incredible work that is being done by @NRT_KENYA @lewa_wildlife and @NATURE_africa to strengthen them. These communities hold the key to saving Africa's great animals.
