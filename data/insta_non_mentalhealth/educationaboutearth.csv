So it really would be nice if consumers could stop buying these things in a manner that destroys the earth so but it's kind of impossible to expect millions of people to stop eating and drinking water. We need reallocation of resources the government to step up accessibility of these commodities instead of enabling privatisation for capitalism|👍|If we use democracy and vote for it we have a chance to make it zero. 🤠🐝|Agreed but easier said than done especially such a large group of people|Am very happy that me and my family get cured from herpes virus and all thanks to Dr zuman for his herbal product that cured me and my entire family.
We had a lot of extended family living with us and at night there was a lot of food and love and after 2 days some of us noticed some tingling in our lips. After the 3rd day some of us started breaking out; we thought it was just spots on our lips but my uncle who had what we thought was a spot on his lip said sometimes people can catch it. My mother and father had it the worst with big sores on their lips. My mother couldn't speak because of the pain but she doesn't usually speak much anyway. She wanted to go to the doctor but didn't. So I searched for any means necessary to cure the virus I came across how Doc zuman cured herpes virus so i decided to contact him because that was my last hope for me and my family so now am free from herpes now and you should know that he didn't not cure herpes only herpes but different kind of diseases and virus contact him today on whatsApp if you are passing through any bad illness on +2348162970721 or email him on drzumanherbalmixture@gmail.com his herbal medicine works for me and the rest of my family check his page on @doczuman.|It s si naive. Exactly. There s 7 bilions if people. A lot of starving. How do u wanna get watter or food to them? How u wanna say those children who goes many kilometres ;take a glass barel! There are those problems to b solved. 1st: what to do with all kind of plastic what is everywhere. 2nd: how to debase already existing plastic things in non toxic way. 3rd; in what range we can repalce plastic to sthg else. 4rdn to do plastic in the way what won t b toxic.

Hashtag to a different audience.|Already have 🙌 N.Y. has already banned the use of plastic bags 👏  We can't stop there all plastic must be banned by 2020.  #climate change  #endplasticpollution  #cleanupouroceans  #savetheearth|No one actually cares. You posting this will leave no impact whatsoever. I mean you can try to tell 7 billion people to shave up their ass and stop but to be honest plastic is actually a huge advantage for us. You probably drank from a plastic bottle just now didn’t you?|We vote with our dollars!|Yessss🙌🙌🙌|90% done - or trying.|That is a good point we have more power then we think|And our dryed up springs will come back and our rivers will return.

It's not that hard to get your hands on a good water filter!|Exactly.|ITS SO SIMPLE .|This photo belongs to me...|then what happened to that plastic bottles they already make? :)|That’s absolutely right no demand will pressurise the single plastic use bottle manufacturers to stop production. In fact I was thinking about creating awareness about small juice bottles and other beverages that are popularly bought in small sizes.|To be honest have been waiting for the bottling companies to announce that they will stop producing single use plastic water bottles. @bislerizone @aquafina @cocacola @pepsi @pepsiindia @pepsico|That’s a fight against big oil co.

We have 10% more bees in the world thanks to this father and son duo!
•
Humans can now harvest honey without harming bees rather than crushing them or leaving them homeless due to more invasive beekeeping methods. The Flow Hive's noninvasive method lets gravity do the work allowing honey to flow via taps directly from the beehive. Flow is committed to protecting bee populations around the world.

That’s a debate|For fucking real bro!🔥🔥🔥|See the trash by the tree how come none of them are dedicated enough to pick up that trash but there out there trying to make a movement it’s absolute bigotry if everybody just picked up that plastic bag rolling in the wind the world would be so much of a better place|Disagree|Cause mars is cooler|No one cares I want to go to mars|Why even have any money at all?|So we can get the hell out of here|Agreed|@nr.ratnasari|EXACTLY we can't ruin another planet|Exactly 👌|No. Explore new horizontal is one way to learn saving the earth|The money spend on those mars things isnt send to mars it gets spend here on earth. Boosting the economy here|Wow. This level of ignorance is astounding.|We are going to mars cuz we know we fucked up here on earth|Yes agree|Because it might already be too late? Elon Musk’s companies already do the most to combat climate change.|Exactly...|Some of the fucking peoples like #modisarkar and #donaldtrump and the president of #china #pakistan and many more will not understand the value of earth till they might not vanished in this pollution.|@gronflaggoresundsgymnasiet|The point of going to Mars is that in the inevitable death of our planet by the expanding sun will put Mars into the perfect part of the goldilocks zone to support life and beacuse there is no way of knowing if changing the sun's gravitational pull will kick start and liquidise teh core of Mars the best bet is it will so yes spening billions on saving a planet that will inevitably die may seem like a good idea it isn't the best one you can spend around 15 Billion on setting up a moon base and extracting the helium and other precious materials for a huge profit and in about 3 years the profit return could be invested into the planets ecosystems but of course we don't have 3 years to do that so putting all the money toward the preservation of earth is a bad idea but putting a fair amount and invest the rest we can not only become a interplanetary species but save our original planet aswell so I disagree with the proposition proposed (chances are it wouldn't happen anyway cause sadly saving the planet is anti profit for multi national corporations)|That’s very true. Focus on solving the problems here before you spend that money on something technically unnecessary.|Because going to Mars is cooler and will further human knowledge more than anything|👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽|But if you fail at rebuilding the earth then you can’t go to mars as a last resort and everyone dies but if you go to mars it’s a saviour and maybe the earth will die quicker but you will have mars to live on it will save more lives going to mars|Nah|Replace mars with wars|i'm agree|True|But we can start new on mars|how about both?|Because if this kids country develops a lazy fat white ass crackhead wouldn't get his social welfare payment to buy Tommy Hilfigers on a christmas sale for 40euros.|So which is it? People claim that this earth is already irreperable so therefore it wouldn’t be possible to rebuild it. I’m hoping the aforementioned statement isn’t true and that we can rebuild it|That’s clownish. NASA and other space and research organisations provide the very science that you fools always talk about. Want more climate action? Fund them even more. Shut up about spending money on earth when that money benefits us both ways!|this some straight retard shit|Exactly!! There is no planet B!!!|That’s sooooo TRUE‼️|Investment in space more than pays for itself in innovation - economics isn't a zero-sum game|@williampricegreen no|Bc its just cheaper esier and the earth will go down anyway|I disagree completely.|First of all we aren’t spending to find habitat in Mars. We are looking for a second earth. In my opinion it is a selfish statement because you are not thinking of the future 100 generations. Our earth is going to be destroyed no matter what. The only thing we can do is slow down the process but it will still e destroyed. Our best bet for the future of humanity is to find this second earth and agreeably give everyone a good education so we have more people becoming scientists.|Much of the technology we use today comes from the space program.|@ecosaveplanet|If those billions that we were using actually went to programs that were serious about going to Mars rather than testing million dollar equipment for theories then it might be worth it.|This is so dumb|Totes.|spend billions on nuclear weapons.|Nah I think you’re focusing on the wrong thing. End corporate welfare!|Sad but true .. Small things make big changes 💪🔥 I've been cleaning the mountains and beaches of Portugal myself trying to make people to act 🚮🛑|Ye we agree 😔 also i have a suggestion !! Just throw all the waste & plastics in space !! No need of other experiments & spending time & money !! Somebody tell this to @nasa ! @educationaboutearth|If we don't change our mindset about environmental issues we will create mars warming in mars. Cheers|@tim_vanendert|@tim_vanendert|👍|Begone it's mars time bitch|💚|I Loved. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟|💖|@extinctionrebellion|You're all pitting the wrong things against each other. Why spend billions on drones guns tanks and other military expenditures that will just be used to invade and oppress other countries instead of cleaning up the planet AND making discoveries about space? Please actually do some research on how NASA's innovations improve life on earth and how vastly bloated the US military budget is before making ignorant statements like this.|Exactly. You know why they do it? Dopamine. I'm serious. It's not sane - it's an addiction an insatiable irrational compilation. Dear robot makers - you wanna feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfied? Be helpful. Service your fellow man. Stop isolating and living in your head. This is not a video game.|I have been saying this for YEARS. So so sad 😟|Absolutely|🙌👏|Disagree.|but mars tho|Meanwhile I've not leave my country yet😪|agreed 👏🏼|Facts!!!|It’s too late for Earth we fucked it all up y’all.  We’ve gotta get to Mars but not stop there DNA demands we get to another solar system—our sun is dying (hence the ice ages)|Totally agreed!|👍|Why have cars in different colors if the cars only came in one color and we save all the money on developing paint tones pigments etc that could be spent on solving world problems.|I agree|Strongly agree|True post :/|@rikusesterhuizen  my maan argument|That's fax|evolution anyone?|I believe rebuild is still not necessary but to clean the planet and reeducate the people for a sustainable lifestyle 💚|Agree 👏|So true!!! Didnt think about that|I dont think so🤷🏻‍♀️ I mean yes we have to protect our world our only pretty planet❤️ but why should we give up the future and the universe? And we are not even close. This is not the situation:this or that.pick one. We never forget that technology did not do this to earth. People did. Everybody's hands are dirty. we tend to think that our effect or our responsibility is less but u know we are millions' and our effect is huge🤷🏻‍♀️ the solution is right there in front of us. For the beginning we should not look at so far🤸🏿‍♀️|Why not do both?|@spacex|I actually think that humans almost can travel to Mars but  still majority didn’t learn how to behave in the SUBWAY 8 a.m. IN THE MORNING. 😅|Even if the spent only the interest of those billions to rescue and repair Earth; it would such a big difference 🙏👍|why only choose one when we can do both if we just invest smarter|Agreed .. absolutely true words 👍|because that’s how our species will survive. if we stay on earth our demise will come sooner or later. only way we survive is if we explore space and colonize|Because going to Mars is cool|👏|I wrote this testimony out of my maximum excitement after losing so much money trying to trade on my own I finally found someone I can trust @jenny_bitcoins_expert is a legit and trustworthy trader please trade with her|Yes!!!! #truth|At some point an asteroid or a rogue planet will obliterate all life on earth. Just a matter of time. It makes sense to colonise other planets to back up the life on earth. I support both. And am glad that there are people who are passionate about both endeavours.|👏👏👏👏👏👏|The countries that are planning to go to mars are usually the most developed|This is why I don't vote|It’s a tricky one. There are a lot of technologies that exist today that came out of space exploration and there will be many more. Grave problems like poverty and hunger will greatly benefit from space program research (incl distribution and production of food ). A voyage to Mars will certainly not be a direct source of food for the hungry but will stimulate technological development and generation of scientific knowledge which will be especially important to the future issues facing earth as a result of global warming|👍Agree|ahem *overpopulation*|Agree 💯‼️‼️|Mars is the FUTURE|Sensible reason 👏|Exactly|👏👏👏|100% agree with this statement.|Fun|I have another question: who benefits most if we all go to mars?|agains human? nations? companies? you need more than billions.
not agree|THIS|I agree let’s fix earth first!!|😂😂|Oh my goodness . This is true . We have a great beautiful planet I love living on it . Don’t give a monkeys  for Mars . STOP WASTING MOMEY .  Spend it here on earth .. 🌎🌍🌏💥|lol|#wmars|maaaars😍|😮😮😮😮👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍|Cuz some ppl think it’s too late and lost all hope for a change|Right 🌱|If it wasnt for space programs satelites etc we wouldnt even have the knowledge we have about climate change for example. We need to keep exploring. A little out of topic maybe but yall know what i mean|😍👍|So this is ridiculously narrow of a view. On the surface it makes a little sense in terms of what we can observe now but the thing that people don’t realize is hugely challenging missions and feats of exploration produce benefits that spread into normal life besides just “yay we got to another planet”. For example the first moon landing mission forced workers to invent hundreds of completely new technologies and techniques that you wouldn’t expect. earthquake proof architecture that protects buildings and bridges around the world rechargeable hearing aids methods for testing food safety space imaging predicting crop yields and plastic free efficient insulation are all examples of inventions that have directly come from space pioneering. When you embark on a new mission it’s impossible to know what you’ll gain from it. The only think you do know based on every bit of history is that the earth directly benefits in hugely impactful ways because of these new challenges that scientists are embarking on. In addition more popular and well known adventures and missions like the moon and space missions help keep science relevant and interesting and promotes learning and innovation in people of all ages around the world.|I never believe in online trading after my awful experience with scammers until meet an account manager @jenny_bitcoins_expert who convinced me to trade with her I gave it a trial behold I receive my profit after 7 days you can connect her on IG|Everyone should check out NASAs publication “spinoff” which is searchable online and it lists and explains the thousands of inventions and innovations that VASTLY improve life on earth and that are a direct result of space missions and research. These challenges of science and engineering do much more than get people to other planets.|Seriously 😒|we have to do both|Absolutely.|That‘s the wrong things brought into conflict why spend trillions on military budgets while we invest way to little into exploring the universe (which could also contribute to ensuring our survival) AND regarding saving the planet that is mostly reworking existing econimic structures which actually does not even have to cost a lot of money just time and brainpower|🔝👍😍|10000%|Good point|Absolutely ❤️🙏|Exactly..|The bitcoin investment I made is with @jenny_bitcoins_expert after losing with a lot of manager stop losing and start wining with a good bitcoin investing manager @jenny_bitcoins_expert|Forreal little man tell em my guy|Basically I commented on this before and im too lazy to say what i said in the other post. However our planet is becoming over populated. I think we should use money to go to mars but we started here so we should repair our earth as much as we could first. Idk if anyone watched resident evil but in the last movie we found out that the Umbrella Co. made the t-virus to wipe out humans so the richest people alive could start a new world fresh. Wipe out people why? Climate Change Overpopulation and too much demand for basic and unnecessary needs. Really and truly unless you want another Bubonic Plague outbreak to wipe out a lot of people so homes could become available for all the homeless and young adults I dont see a reason as to why we shouldn’t use money going to mars while we use money to repair our planet or at least whats left of it. @erland_wi and @daniela.rose.tea have valid points|I agree!|👏👏|Who is this person and how much has she or her government invested in rebuilding Earth?|Right!! !! People are only going to fuck it up as they are doing right now HERE!|“This is now the second letter that I am writing to you beloved. In both of them I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder that you should remember the predictions of the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles knowing this first of all that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing following their own sinful desires. They will say ""Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation."" For they deliberately overlook this fact that the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. But by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly. But do not overlook this one fact beloved that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness but is patient toward you not wishing that any should perish but that all should reach repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief and then the heavens will pass away with a roar and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed. Since all these things are thus to be dissolved what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn! But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.”

I’m sure he has valid reasons|Vanlifers do already have solar panels on their roofs but it's only to power gadgets. They say that aside from the solar panels their car engine charges their batteries too. There's limited real estate space on the roof of a sedan to install solar panels that can power the car's motor or the AC. Maybe for charging the things on the dashboard and your laptop. Unless hyundai and toyata are developing smaller panels with higher capacity?|Start reducing weight on cars and not adding more is what I would like to see.|It’s the next best thing|Makes a lot of sense if you ask me. Cars drive and park in the sun a lot|Follow me for environmental news|Powerful solar panels are advanced. What it takes to make solar panels may be out weighed  to the power it will produce.|Fuck yes!!! Been talking about this|You big mad @elonrmuskk|It all depends on the usage and efficiency. If they can place 1kw of solar on a car you live in a sunny area and don’t use it everyday it can replenish noticable amounts. Don’t expect a huge range increase though. I’d rather have a few extra kw of panels on the roof or in the garden for the same price as a solar car roof or panel.|Probably doesn’t make sense since people won’t have to stop and fill up there car with electricity at your set locations which you are intertwined with the energy industry|Earn up $9k from @gillian_forex_trade|I THANK GOD FOR MY LIFE THAT I AM FREE NOW I WAS A ERPES POSITIVE AND NOW AM NOW NEGATIVE BY THE HELP OF @DR_IRABOR2 WHO SEND ME SOME OF HIS HERBS THAT I USE TO CURE MY HERPES DISEASE AND NOW AM FREE. SO IF ANYONE NEED THE DR NUMBER HERE IS THE WHASTAPP NUMBER.....

(dr.iraborherbalcenter@gmail.com)....|This definitely seems like a great idea in my opinion and the more we can rely on green energy the better!|Solar is practically useless at 0 degrees on a car roof. It’s irresponsible to put a panel that is energy intensive to make on anything but a stationary mount. It’s greenwashing and it’s going to give solar a bad name when consumers find it doesn’t work.|all countries and US and china especially should convert to 100 wind and solar renewable energy! gotta tax carbon😤😤|""wE nEeD tO fUnD"" yea.. sike|ادون ما اتعلمه في كل ما يخص ريادة الأعمال و تطوير الذات📚👩‍💻. I am writing all what I learned about entrepreneurs and self-improvements 👩‍💻📚|ELON MUSK; THE THIEF OF THE INFORMATION AND WORKS OF GREAT INVENTOR NIKOLA TESLA‼️‼️‼️|I think it's worth looking into even if it's not necessarily possible or efficient at the moment perhaps they can find a way to make it so. To rely partially on the sun instead of completely on corrupt power companies? That'd be a nice change.|I wouldn't trust only one man's opinion. The world is full of great ideas. Solar panels are probably best in areas where the sun shines all day and is strong somewhere like the Caribbean coast of Colombia. It would be much better for the environment there and drive out gasoline wars.|Yeah they don’t generate nearly enough power|@lightyear_cars has developed this and it is an amazing concept. They have been working on this for a long time through many prototypes so yeah I think it is worth it all. Remember people thought the same with electric cars|😊|Yeah it was an opinion. You’re not supposed to stop because of an opinion|Leave it out in the sun during summer and yeah u get some charge going otherwise its useless in winter|@matty_ice_miller|Definitely! Especially in places where it's usually sunny like here in the equator!|All coal powered anyway.|says the guy who tried and failed to get electric cars to work 🤣|Makes sense for charging in parkinglots but not for charging while driving|Well I agree with Telsa solar panels need maintainence like cleaning to work well. Solar panels are great but on cars ???|Still makes zero sense... no way you can fit more than 1500 W of solar on a car. That’s barely enough power to charge a microwave let alone an electric car.|He's not the founder he's the current CEO|great sales tactics in the 'climate' of new hysterical religious groups (climate change religion)|gotta love how Elon musks word is the end all be all now 😒|It doesn’t make sense But spending thousands of rand for electricity every month to charge your electric car does ?

It's nearly impossible to find unsweetened plant based milk near me. Sometimes I just have to do without  but if you are raising a family you may not have that option. Instead of chastising people for consuming animal products maybe put some energy toward making plant based options more accessible.

Everyone can choose to do what they want.|Not even milk though|Almond milk all the way|Yes|The same vegan will go eat an artificial chemically infested fake meat substitute. Yeah that was meant for the human body wasn’t it 🙄|Hey is its available here @badass_bhattacharjee__ ?|And grass tity Milk is?|Yh but cow milk hits different|That stuff tastes bad + I grew up drinking cow milk after I became a toddler|I would argue that since humans are among the only species adapted to be able to drink another species' milk cow milk drinking is probably more natural than the mere existence of ""plant milk"". Whether cow or plant milk is better for the environment or a person is a different argument im not tryna have rn foreal🤔|I think that it’s “natural” to milk cows and hunt meat because of survival instincts (when you find food you eat it so you don’t die) but we’re not struggling for minimal calories anymore. The USA and most other wealthy nations are abundant in food; we have the tools to live differently. My view on veganism is that if your body works with it being vegan is the best thing that you can do for your body and health. But if someone’s body just doesn’t process plant vitamins and nutrients the same they should prioritize getting a portion of quality grass-fed hormone-free cut of meat several times a week so they can be the healthiest that they can be. I’m very blessed to be able to do veganism without sacrificing my health so that’s the personal difference that I make. For someone else it might be focusing on low waste (which we should all strive for) because they know that they need meat but they still want to make the world a better place. Do what you can and encourage others but don’t shame them when you know their bodies don’t react to the same diet that yours does 👍🏻|There is another nut milk if you know what I mean|Making it a meme doesn- nvm.|Seriously 😒|it’s not ours to drink|God I love coconut milk ice cream|I drink all of those plant base milks😁🌱🌾🥛|Ancient pagans had a deep connection with cattle. A bit of real cow milk from time to time is fine. Not this poison from tortured creatures that's in the stores that folks drink daily.|Oat🤤😍😘|I don't drink milk any way ..... I have cereal plain....so....😂|And there are a nasty.  Nothing like unprocessed fresh farm milk.|Theres only one milk and thata Cow milk|These are all aynthetic|Protein|Coconut milk and sometimes almond milk!!!💪|Tooo expensive!!!!! 😒|👏🏻👏🏻|I think it’s all ok. Prefer cows milk and think it should just be up to each individual to choose what they want to eat or drink. There are bigger things in the world to worry and fight about. 😉|I think it’s all ok. Prefer cows milk and think it should just be up to each individual to choose what they want to eat or drink. There are bigger things in the world to worry and fight about. 😉|Cow eats grass i drink plant based cow milk i think it works like that|Lol @ titty milk!😂😂😂|BuT iT tAsTe GoOd|@marawhatmough|I would check the ingredient list. There is a reason that 0.75L of almond milk costs $12 at the farmers market yet Silk costs $4 for triple the amount|Rice milk is where it’s at!|Not natural but I can understand how it came about. High fat high protein an essential source of nutrients for many people without access to a large variety of produce hence a dairy animal is so valuable to disadvantaged populations in developing regions of the world. However we in the Global North are privileged enough to have access to a large supply of options so if you want milk for your teas/coffees cereals baking etc. you have a large variety of choice. Oat is my personal preference!|I dont but it would be a no brainer if non dairy milk wasnt in a carton coated in plastic! I dont drink dairy but it's constantly a problem in every vegan or vegetarian alternative.|Yes it is natural. Read some scientific articles and you'll be enlightened|👏👏😆🤣|Yes|Natural? Not really.

You can't make me not enjoy that over plant milk.|Okay soo ik that people like to go vegan and I support that even tho I’m not vegan but i gotta say God literally gave us these animals to coexist with them and milking them and in return feeding them seems like coexistence to me|Okay soo ik that people like to go vegan and I support that even tho I’m not vegan but i gotta say God literally gave us these animals to coexist with them and milking them and in return feeding them seems like coexistence to me|Plant milk is too artificial|I like rice milk because soy milk is bad for the environment.|Tastes damn good too👌|😍|actually they always run out! I had to buy lactose free whole milk ☹️|they need to be milked though or else it’s really uncomfortable and unsafe|Ya cuz plant based milk taste like shit|Why y’all Foyt force people and make them feel bad for drinking the kinda milk they like. If you wana drink cow milk drink cow milk if you want soy or almond then drink almond. Forcing someone to share your view points by being negative will only push them away from wanting to try it.|God: what are they doing?
Angel: They’re making milk plants
God: wtf I gave them like 8 animals to get milk from
Angel: They don’t like that milk
God: tHey dOnT lIkE tHaT mIlK|Ngl I support vegans & I was vegetarian for like 5yrs before I had to stop but every single one of these taste like water that someone thought very hard at to try n make it turn into milk|AHAHAHAHA @brookeparko|... and extracting milk from plants is natural?....|All I can see is a self of plastic waste|Cow's milk natural if you're a baby cow. Plant milk is about as natural as a lot of fruit juices. We have a mixture of plant milks at our house and breastmilk...for my toddler 😅|Why wouldn’t we drink something that’s good for us|It's for the babies. Not for us. I know that for some people it's hard because it is their habit to grab a bowl of cereal with cows milk like me. But what they are doing to the cows for the milk that is naturally produced for the CALVES is just nasty. Not to mention taking the calves away from the mothers just brings tears to my eyes. There are a lot of animals who are tortured and unhappy but cows it makes you just want to hug every cow on earth because of what they go through. So there was my rant about beautiful innocent cows 🙃. Coming from a 13 year old we shouldnt have to tell grown adults that it's wrong. This world isn't going to be a good place to be on soon 😥|It ain't milk if it doesn't come out of a tit.  If you want milk drink the real thing and stop calling blended plants milk.|There is a difference between factory farmed milk and domestic natural production. I'm personally DISGUSTED with greenwashing considering vegan milks and how they are just capitalist fake solution to the current problem.|Cashew Almond and Flax!!|Would be better if they fill it in glass bottles|@benjaminacoca|😻🤩|You wouldn’t leave your fridge door open so why do supermarkets do it? Think of how much electricity they waste!|I use almond milk in recipes but one problem with that is the crazy water consumption of those trees.

I haven't found one I like yet...😛|I drink almond milk|Cows milks good for you loads of calcium|Did you know that drinking plant milk is more unatural? It uses so much water.

Almond milk has pretty much replaced milk in coffee cereal smoothies etc. but I can’t seem to find a milk that I can heat up like for hot chocolate and such. Anyone know a plant based milk that hears well?|Yes but some people can’t afford to drink these alternatives they are either too expensive or not good for their dietary restrictions - stop accusing people of not doing something when you don’t know their restrictions...|But most of these are filled with weird thickeners and oils and all of them taste like ass.

You have to understand that there are so many people who can’t afford milk substitutions so this post is actually very classist. Being able to purchase these types of milk is a privilege.

Just stop drinking milk ffs.  7 billion humans 70 billion farm animals where do you think the problem is? Animal agriculture uses around 80% of farmland but only provides 18% of calories you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to work out that this is massively inefficient and a ridiculous drain on resources let alone a huge impact on the environment.

Its my local shop and where we get our milk though we try to avoid it at times coz of global warming|Great start. Next plant-based milk. Probably not almond because of all the water but something. This refill idea should be everywhere. There could be a marketing opportunity even with store/market/whatever original glasses. Biodegradable cup cozies like the ones at Whole Foods made by less fortunate to give them better opportunity. I think another market that should look into cup refills is the boba tea market.

17,,,"490 Million fewer plastic bags were sold last year thanks to a tax on plastic bags! •
Plastic bag sales have dropped 90% since a 5 pence charge on plastic bags was introduced in England in 2015. The bag tax is also responsible for contributing 169 million pounds to charity since 2015. The average shopper in England now purchases ten bags per year compared to a staggering 140 in 2014.
•
This is the kind of change we're talking about! Also coming to England in 2020 is the single-use plastic ban but does not apply to plastic bags. •

GO ENGLAND!!!|🙌😍|🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿😊|❤️❤️|why did you have to use the bag where they bought tea. IN ENGLAND.|👏👏👏|🙏🙏👍👍|😂 I don't know where you found this but I can assure you is not really true. I always bring my bags so every time someone uses plastic bags I notice it. There is a 5p tax but who said they actually pay it? Most supermarkets have the bags next to the self-checkout tills and people take them without actually scanning the bar code which means without paying for them. Also I noticed that in Marks&Spencer they don't keep them by the tills but if you ask for a bad they give it to you for free. And let's not talk about the off-licence shops (corner shop)! The give you a free bag even if all you purchased is a chocolate bar! So I would not pay that much attention to statistics as they are not always close to reality... Unfortunately.|Here in Croatia you need to pay for plastic bags since I was little and you get refund for plastic bottles in specific area in supermarkets. Simple ways to reduce polution 😊|👏👏👏👏|I love how it has tea in it|Shoplifting at all time high as people just walk out with stuff and pretend they don't buy bags in saving the Planet! Lol|Fantastic|New post guys!!! Please engage|@frances_fancies|🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼|California has a 10 cent tax...|What about those bags people take and don’t pay for? We all know it happens|This is not accurate. Just observe at  a grocery how much people still don't bring their own bags and choose to pay for the plastic bag.|Shoplifters are having a field day it's called the law of unintended consequence s much like virtue signalling buffet activists blocking roads creating miles and miles of standing traffic belching out fumes for hours on end! Oh the Irony lol|Here's what really happened 5p bag for charity bags flimsy and break so people buy bag at 10 20 or even more! Only 5p bags are ones with law attached! And now few buy them!|What we haven't got any refund to take plastics bottles or cans to stores ?????? It's a common strategy to reduce pollution against the environment isn't it? 2. In addition we can encourage people to don't use bags and reduce plastic or paper packagings we should remove this habit to live just like a consumer without accepting any responsibility for our own wastes.in this second way you don't have to pay money just encourage people and give them awareness. You know these importances!!!!!!!!!|How did the fight for earth transform into the fight against plastic?|👏👏👏👏|In my day we just use paper bags for everything I guess your generation like plastic I guess cutting down trees is better than plastic Millennials are so stupid|👍|🙌|Whilst this is good news....The UK's neigbours have been charging for plastic bags for 40 years or more.

Starbucks expects to save $50 million in utility costs over the next 10 years as their environmental plan evolves. The coffee company says it already saves $30 million in annual operating costs with green store practices. (Next they need to get rid of plastic cups and lids.)

The plastic lids? @starbucks how about utilizing plant based materials and maybe give discounts on people bringing in their reusable cups not just the ones that say “Starbucks” on them. Any step anyone and any business takes for action is a great one in which it is greatly appreciated but there are even more steps that need to be taken. Big businesses need to take more action. If it’s just about money then their “vision/mission statements” are crap and lies.|This is a pathetically ineffective act by one of the most giant plastic polluters (per sale).|How about they make any single use plastic item out of biodegradable plastic|But they will go on using plastic  containers so...|Maybe all plastic free Starbucks would be even more effective|unfortunate for many disabled people and not making much of an impact on anything.|Ewww well no more starbucks for me|Get rid of plastic cups everywhere too ! They need to think bigger|When will they eliminate their terrible coffee?|Not because they re so good!! Its for thiere image! The EU decided to forbid plastic staws in 2020! So they have to Change in hole europe and then they could do it at once worldwide|What about the plastic cups? C’mon|YES|Oooooh some straws 🙄 what about the fucking huge cup 😂😭🤦🏼‍♀️|But ... plastic cups lmao|who wants to hype up each others recents|They better sell metal straws or hard plastic reusable ones!|wOWWWWwwww|What about the whole ass big plastic cup 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️|Ooo yes paper straws in the plastic cus|It’s about time 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽|Why do they have to wait to do such a simple thing|Thats nice|They shoulda already done that by now along with cups but ok😂|What about cups?|👏👏👏|#fucktheturtles|Ok but if turtles are stupid enough to lsd lines of straws until they die they should die. It's called natural selection.|What about their cups???|Straws are only 3% of oceans waste I WANT BIG CHANGE ive given up single plastic used all together so should everyone cuz if 1 billion people say “its just one straw” and kill the planet then 1 billion people can say “lets change”|yeah sure|❤️👏|but banning plastic straws could be harmful to disabled people|I think this is a good startfor save the planet  obs: this is my opinion|I’m excited for that.|What’s that supposed to do|About time Starbucks starts acting right damn|What about the plastic tops|Plastic cups and plastic lids!!!!! Straws are just the beginning try harder Starbucks!!!!|What about the deforestation for coffee bean plantation lmao?|Ban single use plastic!|Finally. Can't wait.|don't go to starbucks they support shark finning industries|Like the cups are a bigger waste than the straws🧐|I work at Starbucks and let me tell you. We waste over 100 gallon milk jugs every single day. Into the trash. And they aren’t trying to fix that... they just want people to think they’re “green” so they’ll make more money.|@jess_jac.v7  @_mr.j____|elminate cow milk as well!!!! we need plant based!!!🐻🐻😁😁 that would be a dream😍😍|It’s would also be very nice if they stated to put plant based milk in their coffee|WHY NOT NOW!?!|Hopefully they will then remove cows milk|Not enough. Just yesterday I drank a coffee at Starbucks and requested a real cup as I could afford the time to sit and stay (otherwise I would have used my bamboo cup) and all I could see around was plastic : plastic cups plastic wraps plastic packaging for the coffee plastic plastic plastic. Getting rid of straws is merely greenwhashing.|Disposable cups are fucking our world. If you’re too busy to stop and drink coffee from a cup you need a new job!|This is great news but will straws be available to the disabled who rely on them to aid in drinking out of cups?|💖|But they are just going to replace them with singe use plastic sippy cups. Look it up. 😢|Dude... Their cup made out of plastic... Does anyone didn't say about that?|😂😂 The cups??|How silly 😂 eliminating plastic straws and what about the freakin plastic cup?!|Like this will help with all the other plastic|Get rid of those plastic cups.|Starbucks should just all together fuck off|Do it now|🤡🤡🤡|But didn’t they just make a new plastic lid instead? 😂😂😂|This is incredibly ableist and die my even effect the majority of their waste|i work at a starbucks (inside another store) and we throw away soooooo much shit every single day plastic straws are pretty much nothing. almost everything shipped to us is wrapped in plastic that we throw away all the flavor syrups and shit come in disposable plastic containers we double bag all garbage and throw it away when it’s only half full and not to mention all the cold cups are made from plastic! plus you can’t recycle plastic that has food on it and no ones gonna wash it so it goes straight to a landfill. in fact now that china stopped accepting the worlds plastic to recycle almost no one has done any recycling in almost a year because the US and AUS at least don’t have the recycling facilities necessary to handle our daily output. not to mention the strawless tops are super difficult if not impossible for many disabled people to use.|@starbucks and coffee sleeves and lids! Let’s do this! Make people bring their own cups!|How do they expect to give out coffee?|@starbucks|@starbucks is this true|SAY IT WITH ME!! FINALLY!!!!!|As a retired Starbucks barista I say what they really need to do is start recycling their syrup bottles milk jugs used cups and sending the beans in reusable bags but ya know straws and turtles are more important? Don’t get me started on how no Starbucks has recycling EVEN IF IT IS MANDATED BY A CITY just go to Starbucks and look man not a single one will have a recycling bin.|What about all the other waste? They’re a massive company they could do more|PayPal me a dollar and I'll paypal you a dollar back|wb plastic cups?|Hemp plastic is biodegradable and degrades within 15 days. So if we all just switched all of our usual plastic materials to hemp plastic we could eliminate the plastic issue all together and focus on our other global and economic issues such as the air pollution and clearing out the oceans. Plus of we all began eating plant based foods more often we could fight the pollution and waste issue. I'm not saying stop eating animal products all together I'm saying cut back to eating it a few times a week or something. But I understand the difficulty of being vegan and why others are unwilling or unable to do it.|And the plastic cup?|Why dont they do it now?:/🤔🙄|too late not good enough|wtf why does it take so long ?|🙌🏼|We love ableism disguised as environmentalism 👏|I like those cups without the straws better anyways. Now just make them without plastic|not enough ban the whole damn plastic cup and lid as well force people to bring their own reusable cup if they want their coffee.|great now eliminate the plastic cups|or just ban plastic all together?|How r u gonna drink a Frappuccino?|Gosh dang it|What about the plastic cup tho. That thing is two times bigger|I better start collecting then @taifur_2418|Alri plastic straws so cool but what abt the massive plastic cups they are using ffs|We did it boys litter is no more|Oh you know just go ahead and screw the disabled community 🤷 Many disabled people cannot drink without a straw and even if they don't necessarily drink Starbucks many people use it as a backup if they forget their reusable straws. But you know turtles matter more than people 🙄. If you were actually worried about animals you would focus on the thousands of animals being kicked out of their natural habitats due to construction of new houses 😒😒|When the plastic straws kick in|First thing would be stop faking their fair trade which doesn’t exist.|They need to eliminate ALL plastic by then... Straws are good to go but so are their cups water bottles plastic snack containers..|They need to ditch GMO.  Come on?! Like Panera and Chipotle.  Come on Starbucks step up.|Not enough...eliminate the plastic cups too!|Have they seen the edible cookie coffee cups? That is the way to go!!|Too little too late ramp it up Starbucks... plastic lids and frap cups need to go too!!!|Good!! ❤️|Have they seen the edible cookie coffee cups? That is the way to go!!|And yet it still gives millions of lbs of free cups of water away every year. This obsession with straws is ridiculous.|What do I think? I think it's a joke! The plastic that company produce is outrageous. Plastic bubble lids on plastic cups with plastic straws when the straw is the smallest piece of the equation? Starbucks can shove its little token of sustainability up its billionaires arse|@starbucks so much more you could and should do 😡|@tarynvosters|Ajá y lo sustituirán por tapas con mayor cantidad de plástico no reciclable|Better eliminate Coffee everywhere and cigarettes !!!|But then they're just making plastic lids for their cold cups|2020 is too long|Eh ??? Why so long ? And your plastic cups ???|Seems like they could do it today if they really wanted to.|👏🏼 about time!|What about the stupid little stoppers that prevent liquid from escaping? Those things should have been banned along with the straws|They need to start asking if you want it to stay. They all have dishes but rarely use them.|What about people with disabilities they need plastic straws to help them drink safely and not burn themselves or get the liquid on them if they drink it to their mouth and they can't use paper straws because they don't even work like they just flop and metal straws are a danger to them they could get pierced with the metal straw and get horrible outcomes from that so Starbucks step the fuck up and get rid of your plastic cups and keep the plastic straws which only cover 0.025% of the oceans plastic waste|yee yee|And not plastic cups or any number of wasteful practices? That’s some grade-a greenwashing right there|Bro I hate seeing people use a metal straw while using a PLASTIC cup 🤦🤦🤦|I like this idea but what about people who need straws? One of my best friends is disabled and needs a straw to drink. Since she has to carry a lot of stuff reusable straws get lost in everything|What about the cups?|FINALLY🤣🤣🤩|so they got 3 months to get rid of plastic straws from their shops all around the world|Straws are the least of their worries. What about all the other plastic?!|Good but not good enough. They’re a multi billion dollar company they can afford to invest in 100% biodegradable packaging 🙄|WOW WE REALLY OUT HERE TRYING TI SAVE THE TURTLES 🔥👏🤪|Yeah the cups are made out of gold..|It’s about time but now no cups either please people should have to bring their own reusable cups I|And those green things that they stick in the lids|They still use plastic CUPS.... & BAGS.... this is just a PR stunt. Actual change comes when big corporations fix their behavior & developing countries like China and India which most of the pollution of the world comes from Fox their utterly destructive habits. Not from banning plastic straws from literal plastic CUPS.|Big F*ing Deal -  What about the cups and lids 🤦🏻‍♀️|Demand zero plastic cups NOW or take your own mug. I buy the glass bottles of Starbucks and use the bottles over and over|Idiotic|But plastic cups are still acceptable?? Literally doesn’t make sense|Get rid of all single use stuff!!!!|Why wait till 2020|What about the rest of the plastic?!?|Hopefully this inspires other companies to cut back even if it is just save a buck|Curious how people will drink Frappuccinos|But not the plastic cup.... Why? Basically avoiding fixing the main problem.|Literally one email from the ceo & this can be done overnight|👏|And the cups...?😐🧐😕😪|😂 hilarious... bravo @starbucksmiddleeast|It is so good idea!! 💙🙌|They could do more. This a token effort.|Yeah one reason i dont get Starbucks any more are the plastic lids. Other coffee shops have non plastic ( and a whole lot less sugar in their drinks) so its a easy choice|That's great and all but what do people actually think the cups are made out of? Facepalm|As long as they stop selling reusable straws packaged in plastic at the counter...that's just pushing the issue on another product.|how about they eliminate single use cups too|what about plastic cups? and all single use items?|👏👏👏|👏👏👏|Make them out of plant based biodegradable materials|@marleey_b like it should ever take 2 years to stop using a product.

But will they pay tax?|I think they can do a lot better. It's a start but the single-use plastic cups and lids even the paper cups which are lined with polyethylene plastic need to go. They could change the world.|Its a start !👍|And all the rest???|Why not now!?!|Why can't they do it now? Why do they need a transition period?|Another year of more plastic on the sea?|@ptrkgrnmo|How about plastic cups?!|and replace them with those sippy tops|This is greenwashing! Their straw-less kids actually contain 33% more plastic than a straw with a regular lid!

Certainly money is not holding him back.|And what about all the plastic packaging? Be good to see that reduced too|Damn 2040 :/|Well done Amazon. I used to drive a polluting v8 everywhere.. I stepped down to a low emission hybrid. Next is a Tesla all electric|sorry but i don’t trust a guy that doesn’t have to pay taxes despite being a billionaire.|Perhaps he should start paying tax. That might make a difference.|Go bk to cardboard packaging and stop the Bubble wrap lined parcel bags they are awful|Tbh they should pull down on their transportations period. It’s the current level of consumption that we as humans are enjoying right now that fucks everything up.|Yesssss Amazon!|And what is the footprint on all those elec vans? Not as small as you might hope.|Electric industry products the most dangerous warming gas for the planet. SF6 is 23500 times more warning than cars...|Amazon is investing heavily in developing technologies for oil industry companies to extract more cheaper and quicker. Until they stop doing that Jeff Bezos will never accomplish carbon neutral.|Jumping in the band wagon/hedging bets come to mind. There’s no reason they can’t start phasing in electric vans etc for completion a whole lot sooner. They clearly don’t think the matter is that urgent. 2040!!!|Maybe he should implement a recycling program in his fulfillment centers first 🙄|++5fr÷e|🙌🙌|Where will the old ones gonna end up though?|maybe they should start treatin their employees like humans next|Pay taxes asshole|Considering they didn't pay any taxes they might as well spend thier money on something good for the environment|Hurry it up @amazon with all that money this could be made a reality over night!|Awesome 🙌🏼|There’s electric vans? I need one too|Amazon (not the forest) can crash and burn for all I care there is nothing that they can do to undo all the environmental and social economic harm they have already caused. That’s a drop in the bucket and 2040 is 20 years too late!! Do it now! And how are they powering those electric cars? A coal power plant most likely! F*** Amazon shut down and give all the wealth to society and that’ll do much more good! I fact bazos could solve most of the climate problems single handedly without even a change in lifestyle and solve world poverty!! Will he?? F*** NO! I don’t want to hear about this pathetic bait he tosses us to try to gain points!!|Pay your taxes|That ain’t shit|they are using MORE plastic packaging - I no longer use them|Why don’t they just stop Platic packing 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️|the earth will be dead by 2040 good try|Currently electric vehicles don’t do much to reduce overall carbon emissions. The power still has to come from somewhere. And that’s usually coal power plants. Until we change that electric vehicles don’t mean squat.|there arent good billionaires 🙅‍♀️|There won’t be a planet in 2040 and Bezos knows it.|they could idk not use so much packaging. Think that would make a greater impact. And also drop prime shipping if someone orders a ton of shit. Send it all together when it's ready and not have it all wrapped in plastic.|Btw shop thrive.com they send minimal packaging any plastic is in Ziploc so hey reuse it.  They sell quite a bit of stuff. Wouldn't recommend any of their single serve snacks.  But alot of household items and hygiene products are there.|♥️♥️♥️|It’s a good start. Next stop excessive and non-recyclable packaging|Key word electric. Battery operated with recyclable batteries would be more impressive coming from a mega company like this 🙀|Fuck Amazon bro we should guillotine him|Fuck Amazon bro we should guillotine him|Fuck Amazon|Do more.|WHERE DOES THIS ELECTRICITY COME FROM.

Like STOP using boxes within boxes and on top of that SOOOOOO much plastic.|Amazon->Amazon forest o|To little too late. Burn Amazon and bezos to the ground|I am in accord with those respondents who have categorically stated how protracted this ' generous commitment is ( sarcasm). Mr Bezos is not of this earth if he thinks that is soon enough. Now and now only is enough.|Better plan great idea and the solution to show respect to our planet Earth.

Contact @_mariam_hamdy_ she's an expert 🙌🏻🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴|This is ridiculous Bezoz and his company are a disease for the planet. He doesn’t give a fuck about environment.|Too slow|How much pollution does amazon generate with its vans?|Fucking greenwashing. They dont care about the enviroment and not about the people who work there.|Good job @amazon thank you for clearing the air 🙌💯|Whoa 100000 is that all?|Love this 💯🙌|Their not cleaning the air. They are saying they will try to stay at the same level as they currently are. They are currently at too much. We all are.  Bringing in 100000 electric vehicles might be 1% of their project vehicle purchases. That would mean they are sill going to buy and put on the road another 900000 more vehicles this year due to growth. Because more and more people demand they’re consumer bs on their doorstep now in hours instead of days.  If your gonna demand better you must also do better.|Check your DM|That's not enough.. they need to get rid of all the plastic and find better packaging for the environment at the rate they sell things..|Id be more impressed if they stop using soooo much dreadful packaging|i read this as fans and thought we were gonna try and use fans to cool the earth down..|I also agree less plastic packaging would really help the environment.|Are electric cars really an improvement? There are articles stating they emit CO2 in the production and when charging. Also Cobalt is needed for electric cars which is mined in the Congo which means deforestation. Is this true?|I’m not going to a bitch and complain how late this shit is because ANY great change is change to be grateful for. I mean wagging your finger at a company that most likely can give two fucks won’t do anything. Some people should be happy that they are at least doing something. Something is better than nothing. If nothing isn’t enough for some that I say they have too much time to plan out their expectations on a species that sucks ass on a daily bases. I’m happy! 🙌❤,3572

I was diagnosed with cancer for the past a years  but Dr. Lawson cured me with his herbs and i referred my aunt and her husband to him immediately because they were both suffering from herpes but to God be the glory they were cured too .I know is hard to believe but am a living testimony.

How illogical that the plastic ‘protection’ is killing our planet! Love your feed 👏🏻❤️|Well i agree with this but at the same time those that complain dont do anything about the fact that they dont want to buy damaged fruit and veg themselves. The reason why these are packaged is to keep them in a sellable condition not to make another layer of hygiene. Obviously they/we know that there is natural protection with the food. Make ppl less fussy and willing to buy bruised fruit and you will solve this issue tomorrow. As is 50% of fruit and veg ends up being thrown away due to damage and the supermarkets have to pay for that loss. The wrapping reduces that cost and wastage. Image the waste without it?|what ? whyy|fucking stupid thats the pointless thing i've ever seen|Such a terrible waste|Ugh this fills me with rage!|Ugh this fills me with rage!|So pointless it hurts I rather buy more expensive food that's not in this wasteful packaging.|That’s like wearing a condom if you have a vasectomy trying not to get pregnant.|Wtf is this? 🤮|🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️|Stupid af|wow humans are idiots|This ridiculous.

What is this world coming to!|Apart from this that i agree what you had said when buying fruit and veg people pls first choose to buy your local fruits if thete is availabile.

People who gets mad at images like this don't take the time to consider plastic reduces fruit going bad due to external agents substantially. Supermarkets are not that dumb and they have already gone through the dilema of polluting vs reducing food waste you do the math which is more important.

Like what made you start needing more packaging?|Sans|SANS|Insane|I already cant peel the orange bow i gotta strugle to open the plastic?!|🏎💨🌍💥👎|I don't know what the purpose is but the good thing about capitalism is that the fruit company wouldn't waste money putting plastic on it if it weren't useful in some capacity. So no it's not useless. Corporations aren't just these evil Boogeymen that do nothing but kill the earth. I know that moral neutrality is a thing that environmentalists and other types don't understand but capitalism doesn't see right or wrong only money. If it were profitable to save the earth they'd do it but it's not.|If only orange would have skin...... 🤦🏼‍♀️|Very unreal! Some people think that wrapped fruits mean less contaminated.

 So for tens of millions of years the dinosaurs existed in triple the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and were dependent on those levels of carbon dioxide because most dinosaurs were plant eaters.
 I’d say today’s problem is science that isn’t challenged with peer review where 90% of in named and faceless “ climate scientists” agree on climate change no peer review on how they got to this irrefutable conclusion though very strange.|@avani_pat look at my hero go 👏👏😍|Oh look.

27,,,"Coconuts are a beloved snack all over the world but their outer shell is often disposed of in favor of the fruit inside. Michiel Vos has invented a way to use all of those discarded coconut husks to make shipping pallets that could save 200 million trees a year! •
Coconut husks are a viable and more sustainable alternative to timber which is used to produce 1.7 billion wood pallets every year in Asia. Vos is the founder behind Cocopallets a company that produces pallets that are 100% biodegradable and prevent deforestation by saving trees typically cut down to produce traditional wood onea. •

Current wooden pallets are renewable ( companies and grocery stores send them to recycling plants where they are sold back to other companies) and in order to harvest wood logging companies can only harvest a small amount of trees in an area to ensure the natural habitat grows back quickly and the effects on wildlife are minimized clear cutting land to make coconut farms has much worse effects. The biggest problem that he pointed out  is that the wood is shipped across the world to make it to where they are needed and making coconut pallets won’t solve this because they will still have to be shipped long distances. This is a good idea for re-using wasted products but it would be better off if it was used as a solution for plastic packaging for things such as produce.|Nah its hemp|This seems great! 🥥|Come to st.

Besides resources for renewable energy is expensive. For such a huge project it will understandably take years to complete. And the manpower! These things are done in phases not all at once. So maybe 1 new renewable energy source takes about 1-2 years to be completed(and that’s if they work really really fast) and you have to remember Germany is pretty big too they can probably at most work on 5-6 areas at one time. 
I read that some one believes that it should all be shut down at once but the people need the energy! They can’t shut it all down and than build. Then where do they get the power to build the new renewable sources with. 
Others may ask “what about just using solar panels” they aren’t enough to power an entire country! And they’re very costly! 
Also workers right is a thing. I know Stalin’s 5 year plan was very quick but look at how the worker’s suffered. The people working on it need time too. 
So let’s be patient? Change is better than nothing. An effort is put in nationwide at that and that’s all that matters.|It’s only 18 years from now it’s totally reasonable because of the fact that they have to figure out how to start manufacturing things without coal. They have to build more plants and factories and money is a thing... it’s totally reasonable. Don’t get pissy when people are trying|It should be by 2030 at the latest especially for closing their coal plants. They don’t need to be at net 0 by then but they need to be moving towards it at a faster rate. We all do|Bull shit Germany is not one of the biggest consumers of coal. Not even close.|It should be at least by 2030.|A few years ago they said 2021 so yeah...|I thought we only has 12 years left?|@devmckey|Well that renewable energy better be nuclear power or else they are fucked|good its a start|That's too late|I live in Germany and yeah its PLANNED but it's German politics so who knows if it will ever happen😂|More action. They should do it this year or next|We dont have that amount of time|I don’t think it’s fair that this post mentions only Germany’s coal use. Germany actually is one of the leaders in renewable energy. In 2018 Germany produced about 40% of its electricity from renewable energy...that’s huge! Don’t get me wrong they still use coal pretty heavily but they’re definitely making progress. They also plan on phasing out nuclear power plants by 2022. Nuclear waste is also a huge issue. They’re doing more than you think. Do I wish they would phase out coal sooner yes 100%. But it’s not like their just sitting on their hands|We need to try for earlier because 2038 is too late but it's a good effort!|Only 2038|Up|both|2038? That's not a real year|Ideally it would be implemented sooner realistically Germany has a massive population and they need to do this gradually so they're not screwed in aspects other than environmental protection.|They have said this for years! So will china aswell and they have closed many last 2-3 years|Far too late. There are forrests and listed monuments demolished just for coal actually right now .. #hambi #alledörferbleiben|Better than nothing - but I wonder if they could try to do better given that this is becoming a crisis rapidly.|What a bunch of idiots|lol there will be no one in 2038|Heh it's not about politics in this case. Countries cannot switch between main fuel sources so quickly so it's rather understandable they'll take a while. Although I agree 2022 is a much better date than 2038.|It’s a tactic that countries are doing to make it seem like their going eco friendly when really they know by that time the damage will already be done so they purposely set the date later when they so easily can shut it down so much earlier they just want to keep all their money and powers.|2038 is very late. They definitely need to close them sooner than that maybe 2028.|Its already too late and this is going to happen till 2038 .... it's enough time to extract all the remaining resources .... that's how govermments fool people ...|19 more years  of heavy🙄 pollution ?!?!?🙄|2038 is too late|Countries like india and china would never stop and people like you are still complaining about my country smh🤦🏼‍♂️|The comments shows what a freak show humans are.|i think the late date is in part so that people working in the plants have time to find other jobs/other jobs be created so that more inequality isn’t created like how it happened in the uk in the 80s|Tf do you want? For Germans to live without enough electricity  for a decade or so while a fat ching chong produces 2x that of the entire country with his one factory? This isnt a conversion that can happen after one night this is actually quite soon|A lot of their energy comes from coal so it will take a while anyway and they need to leave some time for the energy providers to switch all up|It's too late but something is better than nothing|Obviously it's better than nothing... but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done sooner. Action definitely needs to be taken now... while we can still help.|Can y’all stop saying that we are going to die by then. It makes me scared as shit knowing that I won’t exist over 20 years. And it’s annoying as hell|But at least they are doing something. Better then nothing|People are saying that they need to do this earlier but it’s really difficult to close all of them down|Let's all make love with dinosaurs and tickle their feet|Yikes 2038 is too far away....world ends in 12years as says @ocasio2018 🤷🏼‍♂️|It’s a great idea but if we keep setting goals for the future instead of acting now it’ll eventually be too late|They can do better|Better than nothing. An aprupt stop of coal energy would make us too dependent on russia taking their gas is too much dependence already. Not only that it would also just be too expensive for us citizens to pay enough taxes for that. We got rid of nuclear energy too renewable energy sources only would in the end only lead to deforestation.|🌍♻️🙌🔥|We only have time until 2030|And also closed their Nuclear powerplants.... 🤦🏻‍♂️|Germany is closing all its nuclear plants by 2025 to compensate they are minking MORE ore|It would be more environmentally friendly to switch to nuclear power considering that we currently have no way to recycle solar panels and the effects wind turbines have on migratory birds and bats are devastating.|Waaaay to late 2025 seems like a better plan 💪|It is so stupid because the Coal plants would go offline anyways but no since the government announced this coal phase out the Companies can request a payback|It’s a start most countries haven’t even committed anything let alone a year|More|why not now|Germany could cover 250% of energy needs eith renewable energies but sadly the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time to. Unfortunately the types of energy we currently have are not efficient enough.|Go Germany!|2038 is too many election and too many different people/governments/politic strategies to come and it is a statement that can be changed at any time!|it’s too late by then|Better than nothing!!! Some countries have no plans to get off of coal!|That year must be either 2020 or 2021 maximum in my opinion|Why not now 🤷🏽‍♂️|It’s not about this few f***ing coal plants it’s about the burning Amazonas for f****ing intensive animal farming....🙄🙄🙄|I think we should be busy fighting Trump’s opening of the Arctic Refuge.|🙌🙌🙌|We have less time than that|Defiently better then nothing|🙌🏻 ehem we don’t have 19 years to wait|🙏|I mean 2022 is more ideal....|Love. #unlitter. Curious? @unlitter ⚡️🌎✊🏼|To everyone saying it should happen sooner yeah you’re right we should close them sooner as we don’t have much time left but Germany is currently also actively shutting down its last nuclear power plants. Yes it needs to be faster but we still need energy. It’s an extremely risky try to shut it off simultaneously as itself doing it faster is impossible|ITS to late we are fighting for 2025|Yes it's better than nothing and better than what most countries are doing. the majority of emissions come from land usage. It's actually quite a double standard that european countries like Germany (i'm german) cut down all their forest (formerly close to 100% of the area was forest today it's obly 32%) and are mad at others when they do the same. I don't mean to say that we shouldn't fight it beyond borders but i can see why brazlis president isn't to amused about all the europeans sanctionning him for something they did themselves without any consequences. European countries should just admit their failured that would only make them more credible.|It’s way too late. And besides it doesn’t seems as if really something‘s happening. The‘re even new lignite factorys build here...|It is to late in 2038! We have to work faster! 😰 do we really santi to destroy our home? It will not exist a second earth! 
You all at reading this no-plastic or pollution textures and you all say:” yea! Let’s stop this.” But do you really do it? NO. Some of you maybe 20% of our population... it’s not enough. No intelligent species would destroy her home! We are terrible! Think! We don’t have much time. 
WHAT WILL WE DO IF THE TIME IS OVER??? We can live. But this doesn’t mean that we will live good. 
Just think about it and maybe you could delete some plastic items like a plastic brush- wood brush- it’s not difficult. 
SMALL ACTIONS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 💪💪💪|Germany tried this before and they failed so badly they did so much damage by having to shut off the coal fired plants and then fire them back up again. Do your research.|I see many people open their Mouth  but have no clue about this|Nuclear is the way to go.|@milesforwishes|Os too late.. 🤔|sooner. it will be way too late|I swear it’s gonna happen a lot sooner than that 💯 trust and believe|MORE ACTION 😯!|We'll be all gone by then.....|It’s better than nothing but more action should be taken|👽👌|otherwise we have to burn them😉|I'm living in Germany and honestly this is so stupid by 2038 it will be way too late|It should be earlier. By 2038 it’s gunna be too late if we do something it has to be now 🤷🏽‍♀️|I say it’s a not beneficial by 2038 I say by 2025 or sooner than that would be much more stable|And then they will still not do it 😉|Too slow|This is false lol|....sooner|I believe it should all should be shut down at once BUT I guess a society that relies heavily on coal must ween off of it now than never. I just hope that they'll be coal-free before 2038. Hey maybe 2038 is just what they think MIGHT be the deadline! Maybe they'll accomplish a coal-free society sooner than that! 🤗|Better than the U.S.A. ... Right?|Ok why not start with closing NUCLEAR PLANTS. They can cause more risk than ever . One crack in the wall our lives are DOOMED . But i still think they should start early at closing those coal plants|Better than nothing!! 🙌👏🙌|R we still going to be around by then?|Too late|I'm from Germany and believe me this won't happen. Our government can't get their shit together and promises things they won't do in the end. Have you seen our airport? Still not finished after 13 years cause we can't do shit|2038 isnt that far awaythough|And change doesnt happen overnight. It takes time and they heavily relied on coal plants so it’s gonna take years for them to successfully switch to renewable energy|I think 2038 is a bit too late if they set the date to 2025 then I would be happy|@earthsong2019_ ⬅️please go to their bio and vote! It’s so that people under 18 can have a say on climate change matters. It’s really quick and this is something which is so important right now!! :) thank you|18 years? Geez|can anyone read ? it says BY 2038 not IN 2038. that means they are currently working on it or have been working on it. they aren’t just waiting til jan 1 2038 to shut down the plants..|This is not true it will shut down on 2025 when everyone dies so there’s no one to operate it lol|Too late|More action! There are still villages that have to move for coal-plants in North Rhine Westphalia 😡|🙌|🙏|👌|Yessss 🙌|I’m fkng moving overseas I swear @lauraread_|I think close down coal instead of nuclear at least in the beginning. In Hambach they have three coal plants which each one of them are among the 10 sites in Europe producing most CO2 in Europe|@nklsbyr I think we should live in Germany 🇩🇪|More action|By the 2038 we won't even be alive.|Hope dies at last|I think it should maybe try to be sooner because by 2038 it may be too late|It’s way to late ... I hate most of the politics here ...|Other countries will do it in 3038 so this is a step in the right direction.|Needs to happen sooner all these politicians making money from all this but what they dont seem to realise is how are they going to spend all that money when the planet is gone and were all wiped out??|Greenwashing 👎🏿",9977

Love this ❤️|It tastes better when it’s glass! And it looks cool too 😉|TRUE ! GLASS better than plastic|Glass takes so much more energy to produce and it never biodegrades. Both can be recycled|I still think they should use the glass better or just have a big refueling clean water at every market or anywhere. and always keep a reusable bottle anywhere you go.|You should check your facts before posting things like this. Both are harmful in their own ways the only reason I'm saying plastic over glass is because it has a smaller carbon footprint than plastic. Carbon emissions being one of the biggest things for global warming. Glass would be a great alternative however you need to consider there are multiple parts to it. Anyway thanks for listening to my Ted T|The weird thing is that one of the main reasons they changed to plastic is because they where being told that it was too bad for the environment and everything paper or wood was also destroying our planet 💕|Я хочу туда!|Yep i'm glass bottle lover 😻|Funny they forced us to use glass then Forced us to use plastic now they are forcing us to use paper and glass again . Dumb asses can't make up their minds . Its about control more than anything !|We need to go back to glass bottels/jars and brown paper bags❤️|Yes it was much better👏|Everything tastes better out of glass. We always choose glass of plastic.|Menurut klean kekmana? @makaryshop9066 @kathryn_panjaitan|Menurut klean kek mana? Apakah kita harus kembali pake kaca? @makaryshop9066 @kathryn_panjaitan|Yes glass bottles may be better than plastic because the just break down in to sand not micro plastic but glass ya a tone more electricity (releasing more green house gases) and a lot more water. Also it is cheeper to make a new glass bottle than recycle one as it uses even more resources. However plastic is definitely not a suitable solution. I think a reusable glass bottle would be the best option for them environment. ♻️🌏|Wish it were still like this|I hope we go back to glass!!! Plastic is harmful and a bio disaster!!!!|Glass is only better IF it gets recycled!! Glass never ever breaks down in a landfill (compare that to 1000 years for plastic) and so many people throw glass in the trash because their curbside recycling program doesn’t collect glass.  Please stop glorifying glass so much!|That’s how it was it can be that way again. Most of these items we don’t NEED anyway.|The same corporatione replaced quality in exchange for cheap disappointments that have more expensive karma attached to it. Plastic breaks. Plastic melts. When a drink gets left out in the car during summer and it tastes off the plastic seeped into that drink ruining it on a chemical level.|I think it is 70s|honestly when snapple replaced their glass bottles with plastic ones i stopped buying them all together. maybe if people buy more glass bottle sodas then companies would get the hint.|There's places in the US that aren't recycling glass anymore|Tastes better from a glass!|And you could recycle glass which is becoming harder and harder.

Since every company insists on having their own shape the whole pawn thing we have going on isn't that effective and environmentally friendly... It's a lot more driving and co2 emissions than it would be if they were all the same shape...So multi-use glass bottles that all have the same shape so they don't need to be returned to a specific company would be the best option|We need to go back to using glass. End plastic forever|But yet they cant go back to that? Interesting.|Is that not a plastic 2lr in the cart|why do we still have the same basic flavors in every store|i need sum new shi|We always drink water in glass bottles|Unfortunately you can't really find other beverages in glass bottles anymore. Or at least it is not that easy|Yeah and then there were the days when I was a kid and they delivered the milk on the back porch in a glass bottle! How about that? That wasn't even that long ago! In the 1950's in California.💙🌎🌱|Glass is sadly the way to go for reusable bottles. In Germany we still have many reusable glass and PET bottles. In the US sadly Glass is not a good option as those bottles are single-use only. Because of their weight and the manufacturing single-use glass bottles have a catastrophic carbon footprint. I wish more countries would establish a deposit system on beverage containers so that they would be refillable and/or collected for recycling much more.|I thought this was risky using glass incase of brake ages but rememberd most wine bottles are made of glass -  and there has never been a problem there!!|Bring back glass bottles|❤️|Where I live they stopped recycling glass and only recycle plastic|@j.lo.bianco ecco come lo sapevi|🙌🏻🙌🏻 It’s sand eventually|Yes we should always prefer glass and just stop using plastic whatsoever|I agree.|Beautiful! Go see if you like my page too and follow me too. 🙌|It would also be aluminum too|Glass takes more energy to produce and to recycle. So the only way to really make it work is to reuse glass packaging like the beer bottles and soda bottles in restaurants.|It looks better too|Wish today was like that!|I wish we'll see these type of bottles  again ...|@dana_delano @balacroix|""Good old times""💪|Agree! 🙌🏻|Or the option of not buying it at all and take ur wafer from a water source !|New post guys!!! Please engage|We try to use glass over plastic (rather unsuccessfully as we buy big being 9 of us and glass usually comes in smaller quantities) but at least here in Liverpool Street plastic BOTTLES are the ONE kind of plastic that IS recycled. It just makes me cry so much that that all the OTHER plastic in the city ends up in landfill. Anyone know a way to recycle all those crisp packets bread bags film tops and etc.... I tried eco-bricking but not successfully.|Better to give up on this altogether.|Good boy|Hm and what to do with glass bottles? I wish they could be collected and recycled. And the time of plastic decomposition is around 450 years while with glass it's undetermined|Glass is a lot more dangerous|❤️|1980s was a better time to be alive in the western world|I work for British Glass so definitely 👍|We could return the glass bottles to the distributor. We should make companies more accountable for the waste they generate and to take greater responsibility in collecting their waste for recycling via their existing distribution chain. It's possible. It was done before. I'm old enough to remember that.|Force en to make glass again|As long as the cost of production is the price of plastic itself is lower than that of glass unfortunately plastic will always dominate the packaging and preservation market the only thing that could be done is to re-use what we buy😔|I never thought i will become financially free while trading binary option but mr Roland @rolandjohnsonfx here on IG made it possible for me after been scammed months ago.

For those that hadn’t considered this at all that is literally the definition of privilege or ablism. It would be great if another type of packaging was used absolutely. So maybe you should mention that in your caption and start campaigning to companies about alternative packages instead of just saying this is stupid.|@israeldiazck2|Ok so.. first why would u do that...second if u did that why would u leave the seed in?|Wtf|These and pre peeled oranges are for disabled people.  If you can peel fruit yourself it's wasteful to buy this.|i mean i understand that prepeeled fruits and vegetables are mainly for disabled people. but then again a lot of just lazy able people buy them becuase it’s less work thus making stores stock more of them and creating more trash.|@aa.kisha @__dana24|I don’t get it|@kristine.locks.in|More plastic  and styrofoam for the Earth!!!😡😡😡😡😡|it’s for disabled people. you & everyone else in the comments look like an asshole|#idiotic indeed|@spiky.friend|This angers me deeply|Yes|literally i just wanna talk with whoever thought this was a good idea...|this type of packaging is meant for people with physical disabilities who cannot cut the food themselves.

Lots of people are spreading this situation on their social media and we are becoming aware of it little by little but it's not enough. 
That's the reason why we are trying to make the #seedchallenge🌱 viral. 
Everyone who participates should plant a tree so we all can replace the trees which die every day. It's just a simple task planting a seed in a small flower pot at home or in a nearby park.
In order to participate you'll have to post a photo of the tree you have planted with the hashtag #seedchallenge🌱 
Nominate 3 friends so they participate as well and add a warning about the dangers of planting an invasive specie or one which can't adapt to the climate.

We do this at my liberal arts school and it is genuinely the best thing|Absofuckinglutely|Most definitely you can see how little adults care about climate change and pollution maybe if they were esucated about it more at a young age they would care and would be doing something about our dying planet.|Omg yes! There is so much they should be taught but instead we gotta make our kids stress balls about tests and homework 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️|YES|Yessss!|Most definitely ❤️🤩|""Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once"". MEANING:
Coward will die many times meaning they will repeatedly do the same thing over and over while the brave or valiant will only die once because they tried|In my opinion yes!|Absolutely! This is a great intro to biology and life skills|Yes! I see no downsides to that. I personally would've loved to learn about that when I was still in school|Yes I loved learning about nature as a kid|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Why not|Yes well considering I learn how to find  the circumference of a damn circle instead of things that would actually help with our future and future generations. We should be learning stuff like this. Including how to pay bills and taxes n stuff🤦🏼‍♀️|Nah just show me how to grow that gas 😏|We were|I mean parents can teach them but ye that's cool too. Also yes save the turtles every day I keep on eating the same plastic bag and it's not fun|Yes|Yes for sure❣️❣️❣️|Yes|YES|Yes!!!! It’s an important skill that is being lost!|Ya|100%|Definitely!|YES|Heck yes|Yap 💯|Yes! They are all being offered robotics.

Schools should also think about actual ""education""|I think yes because we are getting used to care our planet. If we learn from kids how to plant vegetables as we grow up we can also plant trees at a burned forest or sth. We did this at our school last year and I’m glad cause we had fun to and it was worth it! As we have fun we think it’s nice the all process so we have a motivation to plant more!!!|I would rather have them learn that than  learn to take a standardized test|100%|Absolutely|Yes !!!|Of course|Yes.|Yes!|Yes|Most definitely yes|No maybe as a side class you can take but you're are not forced too.|yes! i also wish we could learn home economics or cooking. all of the schools i’ve been to have completely done away with all that.|Yes!!|Definitely! I wish I would have gone through it...|ABSOLUTELY 👏🏼 💯|This shouldn’t even be a question OF COURSE IT SHOULD!!! 💯✊🌱🌎|Yes! My school took us on multiple field trips to learn about greenhouses farms vegetable gardens and even had our own herb and vegetable gardens! I feel that you have much more respect for the environment and the people helping build that environment when you are exposed to real world education like this!!|Why?do you want this to be boring too?|Yea it’s fun and you got to waste time instead on doing actual work|fortunately my school took a field trip to the local children’s museum and taught us how to plant and harvest crops back in like second grade.|yes! Yes yes yes!!!|Of course!! Plants are a part of life all I remember being taught about in science was that I had bones😂 real life skills should be taught we should invest in inspiring kids to be sustainable!!|No|absolutely!!|YES!!!!!|Yasssss|Yes|Ofcorse|My primary school had an after school club called gardening club lol|yes!!|Yes!|It's a must!

Aquaculture would also be an awesome thing to teach as well!!|No tf for what?|Yes!! Some of our schools have greenhouses and horticulture classes.|Durrr|Yes when I was in primary school we grew a several greens at our school and it was great to do something practical getting outside and getting stuck in - I think it should be added!|@jeremiahshim @claire.jk @phoeberosekim @reilly_n_ @veronicafurnish YES|Yes|FARMVILLE😂|Yes😍|Yes but you shouldnt have to take it if you aren’t interested in what you wanna do for job stuff|YES|I'm 100% on board! This would encourage kids to eat healthy in a fun way! It would also help the planet and make school more enjoyable. This might even improve the mental health of our students because they're not as stressed since the day before enjoying some part of class.|I was in grade 3|Please no. I’m in 7th grade and it would destroy my report card (in a bad way)|Yes|Of course|YES|Yes|YES|no|Yes!|Yes the should|Yes|Did that stop being a lesson? We had rural studies when I was at school. Learning about growing things and crop rotation.|I think kids would enjoy it and they could learn more about the ecosystem and the water cycle|Yes and yes!|My school is too lazy|We did learn how to grow food at the age of like 6 here in the UK when i was growing up in the 90s... Should 16 year old fake environmentalists stop acting like everyone before them was some forest burning fish poisoning asshole?|Definitely!!🙌|Yesssss!!!|Yesss|Definitely. Will help them understand so much about where foods come from plus help them appreciate the effort that goes into growing them.|Yes|Yes 100%! At @whatshottvshow we use our platform to educate everyday people about being socially conscious. We also have a network of ecopreneurs that bring more awareness to their niche initiatives and the market! We believe it is ESSENTIAL to learn and educate people and especially children! The next generation won’t learn unless we teach them!|I'm doing agriculture next year for my senior years and the school is already doing agriculture|Yess!!!|My kids (grade 1 and 5) have a community garden by the school that the entire school participates in maintaining|Definetly omg|YEEESSS|Definetly yes|I do at school|@spydrmonkey|👏that's great|Absolutely|Yes|Yesss|Definitely.

I continue to teach my children.|I actually think parents should be taught as well. I feel like this is an activity for the home. I know parents are so busy but so are schools and research shows that dietary habits and house keeping skills are learnt at home and not amongst peers.|Yes. When they grow up they will know more about global warming and other stuff happening and probably raise awareness.|Teach them how to dip early|Yesssss|Yeah we did that in elementary it was fun too|Yes! They’re more likely to experiment with new (healthy) foods if they got to watch them grow!|Yes in case of an emergency.|Defnetly|Yesss....cute lil farmers!|Definitely 👍|Yes !!!|Yes absolutely !|no|I think that would be nice for them to learn so yeah it might be interesting for some of them|Yes|Yes now they should. Get the ready for the great depression again|Great idea!|Yes|hell yea|Yes|So nobody’s sees the kid....?|Nah|Yes|I'm more worried about people being taught personal finance|Children should take field trips to land fills recycling centers and be shown the masses of garbage in our ocean so they can understand and create new ways of living with their bright fresh minds.|I think they should. It’s a good way to gives the kids a fun class and teach them how they can help the environment :)|Yes! 🙌🏼|Yes|Definitely|Absolutely! 🙌|Best idea. And those veggies should be given in their school canteen.|Definitely!!!|Yes|At my school we did that :0|Yes but SOMEONE RUNNING the government will quickly put a stop to that|Yes. No harm only benefits|YES|Yes!!|Duhh !! Absolutely 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯|I love what you do please share my account @give_up_the_plastic to help save our planet ❤️🌍|How about teach them at home|Yes!|Yes!!|The whole point of kindergarten is to learn how to go to school through activities that teach them classroom obedience people-skills etc. Growing plants would be a fantastic way to learn these things while also teaching the kids a huge life skill. Of course we should do that!|lmao in germany this is a thing|most schools even habe a school garden|definitely|Great idea! Most don't think at all about where it comes from & the work that goes into growing it in the first place|I had this in school|For sure|Definitely!!!!!|yes❤️!!!|No it’s bad for the earth|The answer is yes|YES|Yesss I learned around 11 years of age and loved it ever since|I grew up with the value of gardening your own vegetables and fruits. Making dinner out of your own garden should be the norm.|Why would you think they shouldn’t is the question|Yesssssssss|Yes|yes! 🙌🏼|Yes it would help with a gaining a healthy perspective on how to appreciate things in life and what it takes to live a wholesome life|Perhaps.. this'll make changes upon school scorings if this were to happen. I hope it does😁|Actual survival skills? Definitely. Instead they teach us a false history.|they taught us at my school and i loved it|Sure it’s actually useful|yes!!! we planted some stuff at my old school and everyone loved it!|At the very least offered and made easily accessible!|when i was 8/9 i had that in school for almost 2 years. some schools have it where i live some don't|Yes|Definitely it's so important to appreciate our world|Definitely yesss|Kids definetly should be taught how to grow plants but that's not what school is for. Their parents should show them.|Yes!|Yes in Germany we got taught how to cook how to work with wood and also how to grow plants/garden 😊❤|That's was actually pretty normal for me bc our school had a back garden and all classes learned how to grow vegetables. We also visited fields and I was living in a small village so I saw alot of things as a child.|It’s real information I got from my Math class|Millennials are too lazy to learn... but when they need to eat they revert back to others to fix the problem|100% yes!

Amazing!|YES|Absolutely yes.|Yes at my school we have a garden and anyone from our town can get free vegetables|Yesss!! It's not only good to learn it's also a lot of fun! At my elementary school we'd go to this place where everyone got their own small bit of land and we were taught how to grow different vegetables n stuff and how to get rid of different types of weeds it was so much fun AND we got to take home delicious food!|Yes|Yes!|Big YES|Yes|Yes! We had gardens that we grew veggies  and fruits for our lunch’s in elementary.|Yes|yes! it’ll be fun.|Of course yes! There's a difference between agriculture and growing food. When kids learn how 2 grow food crops at an early age by the time they're grown ups they can produce in excess of what they need at a sustainable rate.|My parents taught me to garden and grow veges. Why do schools have to teach these things?  It is a great activity to do with your children and grandchildren 😀|100% !!!🔥|Absolutely  yes!|Every single kindergartner does this|Yes and learn about finances|Yes teach gardening that is organic so compost will be used. Students will discover how a very small seed can grow a big healthy vegetable. Teach them also how and why they should save their own seeds!! 😍❤️|Duh|yes|Yes 💯|of course|We do that in our school and I think that's great 💙|Heck yes!|Definately💚|YES|Yes|I think so!

Sono uno dei formatori Slow Food per il progetto degli Orti in Condotta e ci credo ciecamente 😉💚💚|yess|Yesss|Definitely!|The question needs to be why shouldn't they teach children to grow food at school....oh wait poor food companies might lose business slowly....what a shame XD jk it's a lot deeper than that tbh but it's not a bad idea just depends how it's executed|If they want to survive what tRump is leaving them YES!|Double yessss|Absolutely 🙌🙌🙌|Duhhh|Yes! Absolutely! I remember we had a similar program in primary school and it was so much fun!|Yes|Yes. It concerns me that so much of Gen Y and older millennial generation are outsourcing their nourishment to delivery services freezer dinners and meal replacement drinks that the essential skill of preparing food isn’t going to be passed down to the generation they’re raising. The tactile and emotional benefits of seeing handling preparing and sharing food is much more precious than the time we “save” eating convenience food products no matter how nutritionally-complete they claim to be|Duh ya mama should teach ya too lol|Or maybe at home? 🤷‍♀️|yes|Yes|Absolutely!|I got taught how to plant flowers and carrots at school but if we wanted to go more detailed I'd have to join the gardening club|Yes|This is adorable and my answer is yes.

Next year certain diesel vehicles will be banned from Amsterdam's city center.

Most people bike anyway. It’s the future.|Im dutch but i never heard of it|Just curious how are the charging stations being powered? By coal? Or...what?|Electric cars also present the indirect issue that most electricity is generated from non-renewable sources.. could we maybe just start carpooling more? Or if possible walk/bike to your locations?|2030 isn’t soon enough|❤|Same in Germany...|I guess everybody in Amsterdam wants to starve to death because unless you build a large distribution center where  diesel trucks would switch loads with hydrogen or electric trucks on the outskirts of the city nobody's receiving anything be if food or their mail.|So what about people who just bought a new vehicle and won't be able to afford another when they're all banned?|I was just talking to the other American in the chat. That's why I tagged them. Have a nice day.|👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏|🅷🅸 🆃🅷🅴🆁🅴! 🅸 🅹🆄🆂🆃 🅿🅾🆂🆃🅴🅳 🅰 🅲🅾🆅🅴🆁 it would mean a bunch of chocolate if you can check it out 😅 
sorry 4 disturbing|👍👍👏👏👏|electric cars do not emit less than Euro 6  cars unfortunately|Where do you think electricity Is made? This is not solution...|Going to leave two comments to fully explain myself. ❤️ Of course this is talking about Amsterdam but looking at this from a worldwide perspective: In so many American towns you need a CAR not shoes a bike skateboard rollerblades etc. if you want to get anywhere within a day. We don’t have subways. We don’t have railways. A good number of us (possibly most but I haven’t checked statistics) have to take the interstate just to go to work! Have fun rollerblading down the interstate. 🤣 People here are saying that towns can’t ban you from biking. Actually yes they can and they do. Most interstates ban cyclists. So there you have it. I’ve taken public transportation before and it took me two full hours longer to get to my job which is literally a 10-minute drive to my house. And if your town or city is unsafe simply carrying a weapon is not the answer. You should always have protection no matter what but it’s not enough. Not to mention that there’s a powerful political movement to ban firearms assuming everyone would be brave enough to use them in the first place. Unless buses can be affordable and time-efficient most American towns need personal vehicles.|Continued... ❤️ And in order for people to have cars they need to be affordable. Electric cars are currently not affordable unless you have around a 6-digit income. People like me on minimum wage working 3+ jobs can’t afford a car like that. We end up buying unreliable $2000 cars or making payments for years and years. Unless electric car prices can be capped at $2000 (when would that ever happen?) we can’t afford cars like that. Our job options would be even more limited because we’d be stuck with whatever we can bike to because buses aren’t time efficient. Then there’s the issue that it’s about as polluting to build the components for electric batteries as it is to just drive a gasoline engine so this doesn’t even solve the pollution problem! It’s a step in the right direction though. They’re working on making safe batteries but they’re not there yet. All this is happening way too late. I’m afraid that governments are going to have to step up and take more control of large corporations and force them to stop producing dangerous products force them to cap prices on safe products and force them not to take out the cost differences on their lower-wage workers. CEOs need to be the ones to swallow it. I hate for the government to take this much control but I don’t see another option. We need change and we need it NOW. And people at the bottom of the social hierarchy can’t be the ones to pay for it.|They smoked too much weed|Will be too late by then|Too late|Better start making non gas cars cheaper then...|Fr a battery it never going to bio degrad|Can someone explain to me why Electric cars are so great? Because making the battery pollutes so much That you gotta have the car for 30+ years to make up for the battery|😂😂😂👎💩|bold to assume we will be around in 2030 tho|It's to late we need to stop now|Good move but do it faster|Dudes electric cars are no solution do you think lithium drops from the sky? No it comes from mines in the Rainforests|I think it’s amazing 😍|Beliving it when I see it.|It's running out anyway 🙌👍|Bullshiit|Doesn’t help if the energy is coming from nuclear powerplants etc.|“Damn” said Amsterdam.|Their economy going ⬇️⬇️⬇️|Amsterdam can use bicycle or electronic scooter because is quite not like city|👏👏👏|Good time to buy Tesla stock|But are they implementing plans to help low and middle class families/individuals replace their vehicles or is climate repair going to be another form of class warfare?|Guys you have to realise that these things take time. You can’t just go up to someone take their car and then expect them to get a new electric one just like that with no savings. These things take time hopefully it happens faster than this though|Doesn’t make sense because the old gasoline cars will be send to other countries like Bulgaria Romania and so on ...|This is so dumb!! They are not ""greener"" for FUCK SAKE!! Battery production costs more co2 than a diesel that ran for 100.000km|can we just plant trees ._.|All these promises “by 2030”. Let’s just see if it all falls through.|I'm a big believer in climate change but I don't think this should be our main focus. If we'd just ditch meat and dairy we would see a huge decrease in the harm being done to our planet without having to compromise on transportation. There are some things an electric vehicle just cannot do when it comes to hauling and towing.|Sooner|Thanks for your input. But I think some one gave you b.s. statistics because animal agriculture contributes to far more emissions than what you stated. And cutting out meat and dairy would be a huge change for our climate. Not to say that we shouldn't change our laws as to what we should be putting into the atmosphere with diesel and gasoline vehicles. But I think if we focused on the animal agriculture industry first and foremost that would be a far more logical way of living sustainably. Also animals don't deserve to die because we think they taste good. So there's that too. ❤️ can I ask where you got your statistics from?|@fynnstaa_ thanks for sharing your source. I read through it and at best the article claims it cannot compare the emissions from each industry due to all the indirect emissions from the animal agriculture industry. If you read the paragraph after the one you cited it claims that each industry hovers around 15% of total emissions.  And I completely agree that worldwide hunger is an issue. But to say that hunger must be fulfilled by an animal based diet sounds absurd. There is literally nothing you can get from an animal based diet that you can't get from a plant based diet; except cancer and other illnesses. Claiming that having animals in your dietary lifestyle on the basis of culture and tradition are merely excuses for not address the issues that clearly need to be changed. We've changed the way we do many things over the years. Changing the way we think about food is just another change we're making. Also there is no such thing as sustainable meat intake; especially considering where the demand for meat is currently at. To think we can have happy little farms raising happy free-range animals is a joke. A farmer simply cannot meet the demands for meat by practicing that type of farming; not even considering how that type of farming would increase cost and therefore the price to the consumer. Also if I were an animal I don't think I'd care how well I was fed throughout my life only to have my throat slit for the pleasure of some other species taste buds. Being vegan is not hard in any way. I was raised on meat cheese and processed foods like most other Americans. I decided to try veganism out. One day I was eating anything and the next day I was vegan; it isn't hard. And I don't spend tons of money on being vegan. I don't know why people think meat is less expensive than fruits and vegetables but it isn't. Also they're delicious. There may be some areas in the world where it's impossible to grow crops so maybe veganism isn't for them. But I'm willing to bet you that those regions of the world are not developed enough to contribute to the massive industry that is animal agriculture and all the harm it has done to our earth. 💕|By the time we dead🤣🤣|Good luck with that idea.... as they receive electricity from burning coal or natural gas.  Sounds reasonable.|If we even have that long|why not now|Bold of you to assume we will make it to 2030|Only when u generate power by other mean. (Without using gas or fuel). Battery is a harmful waste to environment too|It wont Work 🤣🤡. Rotterdam Will be the new Capital 🤡|By 2030 the damage will already be irreversible so what’s the point of banning something years to late ???|And how would they generate power for electric vehicles.|More will follow...|You don’t even need to drive @paulus036|@chef_con_la_testa ecco qui|The switch to electric vehicles leads to another problem of not being able to dispose of the battery ......|It seems we will die at 2029 that’s what I read|Ahahahahha if only we weren’t dead by 2029 if only. This is a great idea like the green new deal that is being proposed in America to completely end all carbon emissions but unless it can be implemented soon what good can happen?|Orrr get this actual company’s could cut down on their carbon emissions instead of forcing people to buy new cars also the quality of green cars generally aren’t great (pulling powercharge etc.) I’m all for going green but there’s things that are major inconveniences for citizens|bold of you to assume we’ll even make it to 2030|Wow that's gonna cost a bit ton of money and could possibly destroy their economy|Ok|But forget that the production of electronic cars and engines polutes as much or more|Suuuuuure|The post above says we're dying in 2029|Will they force electric cars to be affordable for people who don’t have a 6-digit income?|Where are they gonna put all these cars|All the backlash from the car community is gonna be insane|대박이다 리얼루 야 멋졍 대박이네요 잉잉 뿅감|i hope more cities and countries adapt as well! the climate crisis is real!!|After the world ends?|Bravo 👏👏👏|This is so admirable.

Everyone should just eat less meat.|Plastic packing is not ok|The amount of paragraphs here for clout that no one is going to read is hilarious|They kill birds homes by cutting trees and they aren't really taking much food u think cows are all about that bark life|my point 😂|People are cutting down forests for meat and moneyIf you think money is more important than the environment try holding your breath while counting your money 😒|Ob Soja jetzt als Futter für die Tiere oder als essen für Vegetarier und Veganer angebaut wird ist doch egal 😂 ich verstehe nicht wieso keiner drüber nachdenkt das die Flächen so oder so genutzt werden|Ich werde weiterhin Fleisch essen haha ihr könnt mich mal|Dose it count if I only eat Iowa raised beef?

Right.|Bruh ya kiddin me|I think you have no idea what you're talking about and assuming the forest fires arent due to climate change which has many man made causes the worst of which is the oil and gas industry is absolutely dishonest to say the least. Also heme iron. What's your solution for that? Theres a reason low iron has become a meme and it's because more and more people are becoming vegetarian or vegan and not realizing that their body needs iron. Yes theres iron in plants and eggs but that's called nonheme iron. Nonheme iron is about 3-6 times harder for our bodies to absorb than heme iron which is only found in meat. The only reason you SHOULDNT eat at least even a little meat here and there is if you have hemochromatosis which is a genetic disease where your body absorbs WAAAAAAAAY too much iron. So please stop this bullshittery.|Oh fuck off. We would need MORE space for everyone to eat plants 100 percent of the time. Ya I’m a sheep producer and I’m proud.|That doesn’t mean you stop eating meat. All this vegan and vegetarian people thinking that that’s going to save the planet it bs. How about instead of cutting meat out of your diet you actually educate yourself about where the meat has come from in terms of the process. People are so uneducated about the stuff their preaching.

But you are right facts are facts not opinion. I understand your point but people aren't that ethical 😂  I think that it depends what you choose and in my country there are a lot of farmers to ask about stuff and the thing is that sometimes there is so many stuff to talk but sometimes we can't do much about it :c Yeah that kind of talk was nice to have 😊 Good night because it is night time here 😂|@flaviagaldi00|Look up Allen savory on YouTube and watch his ted talk.

Low intensity pasture-fed cattle build top soil (which stores huge amounts of carbon) and support improved biodiversity on land that has evolved alongside grazing ruminants (like cows). The issue is intensively reared soy-fed animals encouraged by globalised supply chains. And let's not forget the rainforest is destroyed for many plant crops as well (e.g. palm oil). The meat vs. plant debate is overly simplistic.

46,,,"India has just launched its very first (garbage cafe) providing food in exchange for trash. Over half of India's 1.4 billion citizens are living in poverty struggling to provide food for their families. The country also has a plastic waste problem generating 26000 tonnes of waste. The (garbage cafe) will provide a full meal in exchange for 1kg (2.2lbs) of rubbish or breakfast for 500g (1.1lbs) of rubbish. The waste that's collected is then sent to a recycling plant which turns it into plastic granules. Like many of India's plastic recycling schemes this shredded plastic is used for road surfacing. There are more than 34000 km of plastic roads in the country. .

50,,,"A study from King's College in London found that air quality inside a vehicle is worse than outside. .
Although most people think that by riding a bicycle or by walking on the side of the road is better we breathe in more pollution inside a car. .
The study revealed that levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were on average 21% higher inside the vehicle with the windows shut than on the road outside. This is even worse when a car is stuck in traffic. .

51,,,"Morrisons is taking a step in the right direction to help combat plastic pollution by becoming the first British supermarket to roll out plastic free fruit and veg areas in its stores. Shoppers will be able to pick up 127 varieties of fruit and veg all plastic-free with the option to either buy them loose or use recyclable paper bags. (What do you guy think?) .

I prefer to take my own produce bags but awesome for those who don’t. Come up Grocers! Get in the #saveourplanet game.|This is definitely a step in the right direction! Our brand does the same actually. We ship all of our products in paper packaging made from the waste of our very own organic cotton crops!|Is there a rule saying we have to use plastic bags... or is out of convenience? Like I always thought it was a rule... may be I'm an idiot...|I was just talking about why they don't have environmentally friendly bags for the produce with my mother at the grocery store!|The fact that this is the first is a tragedy.|@heb are you listening?!|Yet Morrisons throw away thousands of tonnes of parsnips and probably more food and veg because it doesn't meet ""cosmetic/beauty standards"" (either too big or to long or short) and after their supplier spoke up about it they dropped them.|👏👏👏 Finally|Finally !!!!|Whole food the biggest hypocrite in the world needs to follow suit.|My Morrison’s already has this along with paper bags that are waterproof and rip proof for the same price as plastic ones 👏|But are they getting rid of all the plastic wrapped fruit and veg in general.|Thank you|🙌|Too bad they're government is corrupt and will continue to take freedom away|@realdonaldtrump|Yessss amazing|Yayyyyy 🙌🏻|@marianosmarket please please do the same by eliminating plastic bags|@lidlespana @mercadona @ahorramas_com @alcampo.es @carrefoures @caprabo_supermercados|@publix|@cherie73|Finally|@farmersmarket99id please do the same 👏|Are you clear that a paper bag has to be used about 30-40 times to be more ecological than a plastic bag ?|@jairor909|@tescomalaysia please take note.

Milk from nuts can be very wasteful! 💕|Almond milk ❤️|Oag milk is soooo good fuck the dairy industry|I don’t drink milk so that part doesn’t matter to me I only use it for cooking. The “take down” of the dairy industry (which while I feel the demand will lessen there will still be a want for yogurt cheeses and other dairy products) also hurts real people. I know people in the dairy industry they have family’s to feed and animals to take care of. What do people think is going to happen to the cows already there? They aren’t going to just disappear and you can’t re-home them let alone the millions here. They are going to have no where to go and their owners aren’t going to be able to take care of them. They are domesticated animals who depend on people to take care of them so if part of the dairy industry dies off due to low demand where do people think those cows are going to go? What about the families? People who need yknow money to live? Last year the dairy farmers around here made exactly $0. Finding another job isn’t that easy and there would be hundreds of other people looking too. Im not hating on anything I want to save this planet and do my part in stopping the next great mass extinction of us and the wonderful animals here but I want to know logically what people think is going to happen?|I like ripple milk that’s made out of peas|@ju_greed noice|good|almond milk is so good but i really wanna try oat milk|the big milk industry must die|Coconut|Chocolate oat milk is delicious|Oat and hazelnut is my favourite. 😍🙌❤️|Go vegan 🌱❤|Time to bring back the gallon challenge (whole milk only)|I feel like I'm the only person who hates plant based milk.

Not everyone can peel an orange or a banana on their own or even have access to caregivers to do it for them so why not encourage people to be mindful when they can be and not degrade people when they can't?|I don't even bundle my fruit in those snap bags they have on a roll near the fruit.|For peoplr with dissabilities fruit cups and pre cut fruit are easier than peeling their own fruit.|We are over populating|To help raise awareness in the media for the amazon rainforest fire me and my friends have changed our profile pictures green it’s just an idea but we think it could be effective #greenforamazon #greenforamazonia|This isn’t Europe of the USA 🤡|Who the hell buys bananas and oranges like that|No have you ever seen a natural banana? That shit is minuscule. Barely enough for a monkey to think it’s worth as a snack|this world is sad|Totally true|@dewitheodesia|literally no one packages bananas and oranges like that|I really don't understand supermarkets which do this. It's so incredibly wasteful. But I still believe that if we don't buy they'll stop selling! You'll be surprised but in Singapore we have fruit stalls selling cut fruits and you select the pre-cut fruits from a fridge and literally each piece of cut fruit is wrapped in a plastic bag. So if u take 5 piece of watermelon you have 5 plastic bags. How ridiculous is that?|Amazon is burning for 3 weeks now|I’ve never seen this in supermarkets lmao|i hate humans|some people with disabilities need this packaging because it’s easier for them to open. it should still be an option but with bio degradable material that will decompose!|I've literally never seen this. Also from the shape of the bananas on the left you can tell those arent naturally found bananas but genetically altered ones|this is extremely ableist packaged fruit like this can really help people with disabilities it’s not pointless|Just a good little tidbit to also consider; if the fruit is not native to your region you cannot compost it without purchasing something to break it down! Different places have different bacteria that have evolved to break down matter from their area!|no supermarket sells it like that but go off🤡|the amount of ableism in this comment section is so disgusting|I’m just starting my page trying to get more people exposed to the reality of the ecosystem and what we’re doing to it feel free to give me a follow and checkout my page!!!!!!|I've never seen fruit packaged like that|Hate to ruin this for you babe but that banana and orange were genetically modified and bred over the last 100ish years to fit human consumption.

Visited Costco the other day and lots of unnecessary plastic there!

However they shouldn’t be packaged in plastic|this is for people w/ disabilities|When I visited the Middle East they were massive supermarkets which were filled with non eco friendly packaging like that. Everything was in plastic and polystyrene including large quantities of cheap and plastic things like quilts clothes etc that were probably made in factories with no health and safety standards. We need to warn pressure and alert these kinds of countries that do not care at all.|I see those as efforts of getting fruit price up. Wonders of unregulated monopoly...|We're just being retarded...|Yep lol|Peeling is half the fun|@s.w.a.y.zi.e|And paying for all unnecessary plastic packing!!|The ableism jumped out huh|what the truck|such a shame! it also becomes much more difficult for us who are trying to reduce plastic to get packaged free goods|I agree.

In a fucking plastic container???|Im sorry but i never saw a plastic wrapped banana lmao wth|Who the fuck needs a banana wrapped in plastic?! Peel the banana yourself!|This isnt in europe xf|idk if it's an american thing or what I haven't seen peeled packaged fruits and there's plenty of disabled people in my country. never seen or heard of people complaining about that irl it's only english speaking comment sections where I see people defending those packagings. when people are in such condition they wouldn't be able to peel them they'd have some sort of helping person at least for some time during the day. other than this some plastic wrappings are even harder to open than it'd be to peel/chop fruit anyways|So true. Don't understand how much time will people save. 👍|Where the fuckle is this a thing? I've never seen this in America.|That’s just extra|I never buy the ones in the packs.|@kellyslater|Nature did not develop bananas -almost any fruit we eat- human civilizations did.|I lived in the US my whole life and never seen either of these things packaged like this🤣|Some disabled people have trouble peeling oranges or bananas/can't use knives cause it's not safe (cause said disability make it hard) stop shaming disabled people|Allow me to share...

It’s everywhere like that|Keep in mind some disabled people with poor motor skills or chronic pain etc cannot peel fruits and thus need to buy it pre peeled (which ofc means it need and easy to open package to keep it protected). I agree we should all try to use less plastic but in some cases like this it is needed. At least until we find a better way to package it.  Please do not forget disabled people in your activism.|omfg everybody always brings up disabled people

I am against Factory Farms and cruelty to animals.|I’ll eat what I want lol idgaf I give a fuck about single use plastic but we shouldn’t have to change our eating tf|@scarii_68|𝑯𝒆𝒍𝒍𝒐🌻 𝑰 𝒑𝒐𝒔𝒕 𝒆𝒏𝒗𝒊𝒓𝒐𝒏𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒄𝒍𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝒄𝒉𝒂𝒏𝒈𝒆 𝒏𝒆𝒘𝒔 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒗𝒊𝒔𝒎.

If we really want to save the planet we need to stop fossil fuel burning.|yes!! i posted some vegan recipes to help :) 🌱|I quit eating meat almost 3 months ago 😌 not for me but for the planet.|As well as getting rid of 1/3 population plant millions of trees|What is your source?|Yeah me as an individual must change. It’s not the mega corporations that dump plastic into the oceans or the fishing industry leaving their nets in the ocean.|Nonvegans: posting in comments the equivalent of a dog scooting it’s poopy butt along a carpet  while whining since the turn of the millennium.|If the government starts banning meat then u can catch me with the petrol bombs at the ready|STOP EATING MEAT|Then tell the government to stop producing shit that is not helping and that is completely unnecessary!!!!|I would say if we also build using recyclables like plastic instead of wood that would be good too.  All I see are logging trucks and cattle across the US.  Yes the land is used for farms but a lot is just left cut and deforested like a bomb dropped.|Change is necessary!|duh animal agriculture factory farms and slaughterhouses are so awful for the environment. much more than a plastic straw or whatever|'If we all turn vegan will it help the earth?' I've seen this question through out social media at least a million times and on theory yes but here your answer just in case you were wondering: with today's technology we wouldn't be able to do so as you know methane comes from life stock but if our life stock was cold and everyone became vegan could we support it? No. Life stock uses 3billion of ha of grasslands globally and only 700 million of that is croppable. But what about all this grain that livestock's eating? When we harvest grain its taken to a facility where it will be tested it goes through a range of tests to determine what grade the test is in. So if this happens in 7months our grain would be brown or something like this 🍰 but brown or 💩 because of climate change and weather our grain is being put into categories that humans can't eat. So the amount is the problem. The amount of humans. AND the amount of meat. The best way you can help in this case is to cut down on the amount of dairy and meat. And we could start to make less babies. More people more resources. @sorayunn_ (Britney its me megan btw) @hannahpaigemc  I sound like a right nerd but i honestly just care and do my research. And I'm only 11... Btw @hannahpaigemc I Dont mean to offend u or anything I just saw your comment and wanted to tell u that everyone going vegan isn't the best way to go. Also @a_mendoza_96 please plant those trees. But cut down on them meat sesh's 😂😂|Sure since it isn't the fault of big companies ruining everything 💀🤡|Every time I eat out I get a vegetarian or vegan option, however since “vegan” stuff it relatively expensive to buy and cook yourself I’m not with the privilege of being able to afford to not eat meat, people need to consider the expenses of things rather than screaming “DONT EAT MEAT!!!” At everyone.",3841

Always read the small print. Buxton Water etc.|Completely agree. I was working for one of the above companies in Papua New Guinea. The amount of rubbish and pollution is outrageous. Further traditionally people living in these countries food previously was biodegradable. They live on a day to day basis and are not well informed of the impact of littering. Education and recycling programs would be a great start|What else should they wrap it in? Im all game for stopping them from using plastic but if you don’t have a easier less expensive way or any other way at all that they can wrap it in this idea would just be detrimental to the economy and inefficient. Without giving them money to do this they will not give up their companies. You need to learn that they will not do whatever a teenager says without incentive.|They can melt it and reuse it. It’s called recycling. You get refined plastics and metals without the mining.|The companies don’t care for the environment only for the $$$ that they makes from it... sad.|Imagine if every person who still consumes their products wrote them an email asking what the corporate mindset is going to be now given their production techniques are undeniably and obviously an issue for the global environment....🤔🤔🤔 are there public statements available!?!?

This crap (sugar fillied products) are more addictive then drugs and these companies knows that.|The people behind these giant companies are just shameless.|No deberian ignorarlo claramente|👍|Shame Crystal Geyser too.|Coke buys up company’s like Snapple that have always used glass bottles then switches these products to plastic just to save themselves a few cents (times a billion). Hold these corporate giants accountable for knowingly destroying our planet all for the sake of a few rich elites. I think Coke also offer a course at the local university called “how to destroy the planet 101”.|We need to switch to glass bottles|Is nestle doing anything about it?|@nestle @cocacola @pepsi|Hi we are a group of teens trying to give advice on how people can live more eco friendly lifestyles.

Where every coffee comes with a separate Pack of Milk sugar spoon etc. GREAT 🍉|👏👏|Am i just stupid or is this ironic that an airport wiches one of the worst things to climate change bannes something less worse|So all those plastic bottles will still be thrown away outside the airport|Hope it’s all single use plastic bottles not just water.|YES|They’ll always be a progressive forward thinking city.|Do they still dear animals though?

We’re running out of time this needs to happen now.|Greenwashing an airport can’t be environmentally friendly smh|🙌🙌🙌|Just hop on this massive CO2 mobile and we’ll soar thru the skies! But don’t worry we won’t sell plastic anymore....|💕💕|AMEN 🙌💛|👏👏|Let’s get hemp plastics going!|If you guys have a minute it would be awesome if you could check out our account we’re an eco friendly product shop that will drop january 2020 it would be amazing to get noticed before it drops. Thanks! ❤️❤️|Plastics time is over!|Ok but as someone who has a medical condition (dysautonomia) and has to constantly be drinking water & Gatorade n shit. Are they gonna get rid of all plastic drinks? And if so are they gonna start bottling them in glass?|Finally!!!|woooooooo!!|And what about all the other bottles? Or are we just removing the one liquid the body actually needs? I hope they have installed copious amounts of water fountains because at an airport the only drink you want is water|And what about all the other bottles?

This is GREAT. 💜|I love that they are starting this month!|Amazing!!!!|👏👏|Good🐠🐟|That’s awesome!!!! Brands should have to come up with plastic alternatives so we consumers would not have a plastic option. In the 60’s the media had to convince people to use this new material called plastic as no one knew what it was.

Not coke or pepsi bottles along with that? Doesnt make much sense at all. Lets keep selling soda in bottles that we obviously need so badly  but lets ban the sale of water bottles cuz we dont need water at all. How bout we ban having children instead cuz humans are the real problem but all you dumbass people on your 5th kid dont realize that.|Yessss let’s save the only habitable planet we know of 👏|I support this but what are you going to be able to buy if you need a drink?|Amazing!|It’s great|👏❤️|Awesome|👍🏼|Finally....👏👏👏👌|I love this!

In my opinion|Yeah so the roots can grow around the casket and bust it open so the tree can use the nutrients of a decomposed body. Great idea 👏|That’s a stupid idea|Its a good idea but we still need some way to mark who it is that is buried under said tree|#disrespectful|I’ve always thought graveyards were a stupid waste of space. So I think this is a great idea.|This is a stupid fucking idea I dont want  fucking roots growing around my dead dads coffin|Iran 🇮🇷 is doing that to its graves and people are going nuts|OMG I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY!|An excellent idea!|Frank Herbert Chapterhouse Dune|Actually pretty dumb but aight|Could be a motvie|Kinda munted who wants a tree as their grave|Yeah and give our culture to nothing... Fuck dead ones and memory about the them|But then the forest would he haunted|Hell nah... I understand ur point but I completely disagree with u... That's just stupid|Such a great idea! And everytime u visit u can water the tree as growth. 😍|Something like this already exists. For roughly the same cost of being buried you can have your ashes turned into a tree|and it be a dope ass haunted forest with the benefit of oxygen|It’s a very common practice in Canada and honestly it makes the cemetery so much less gloomy because it’s truly the circle of life..|That would be so fun. I  want this for me|sounds great i wanna feed a tree with my corpse|Right!|Yooo I want to pick my tree too|Yooo I want to pick my tree too|I want this for me I'm sure many others do to please make this a more common option!!!! 😍😍|How would you know where someones grave is like how are you supposed to visit the cemetery that's a forest and you don't know where your grandma is berried|We’ve done this in Indonesia|If we were to do this we don’t need to pay for coffins so basically our bodies will become plant food for the trees on our grave|I mean it’s good in a way but the tombstones are there to pay respect-|Imagine if people thought they didn’t need metal and wood polishes caskets to get buried in WOW|Idk how your guys culture is like but in the usa I don’t think that letting the body’s of are love ones decay rapidly into a tree wouldn’t be the best solution|Theres no point of caskets its not like the ones that visit you are gonna dig u out to see u again|I’ve been saying this since I was a kid|I do think the idea of the trees would be a beautiful idea and give more life to the dead🥰|@k.i.j.u.n I want this done when I die|💯💯💯💯|Uhhhh no that’s just disrespect|♥️♥️♥️|@michi_almer heat si eig gaunz cool o|Its a wonderful idea. Less waste. What a way to be remembered. What a way to say ""I love you""|True but the bodies would some times come up with the trees or it will be a little bad for the earth but if we didn’t put any chemicals or shit like that it would be a good idea but nah|Wow not even the dead can catch a break!🤦🏻‍♂️😂|Cool untill a tree picks up a body|@celinazimmer|This is a thing people do you know? Last funeral i went to they put the pot in the groud and a little  plant ontop so it would grow bigger later into a tree|Yee yee ghost forest|this is actually a great idea because if you think ab it’s like that person that passed away is coming back to life but in a better way that will help the earth in stead of destroying it like we are now|This is literally what my culture do|Yup cremation is the best method.|Hell yes|Good idea fuck religion|What if we treated the land that trees already occupy as sacred as the places we store old bags of bones? 🤷🏻‍♀️|you can get special graveyards where a tree is put on instead of a gravestone and a plaque on the tree. You’re in a wicker basket too. but what’s so bad about burying bodies? it all decomposes and after 100 years they’ll be dug up unless someone has paid for that slot for 100s of years in advance. My great grandparents are buried together and we’ve paid for it for 200 years (in advance ofc). I’ve seen many graves that used to have someone there dug up there. They just won’t remove any from the 1800 as they’re seen as historical. i don’t know if this is the same in america or not but it is in the uk at least in my area|And will be still alive.. 😇|That's what Hindu culture do|I think it's a great idea|It’s a great idea then we could ingrave the names of our lost ones on the tree and it’s like they have new life|They already do that back in my country|Its like when you plant the trees it would not take 70 years to grow just saying. Oh and maybe The sprouts would be stomped either accidentally and erased all the progress|Graves are reused after a few years. Where do you wanna bury all those people|No I want a marihuana plant on my grave|Yes it is!!|They’d have a whole ass tree dedicated to them that going to be in my thing. I want a tree instead|absolutely i wanna have my personalized haunted tree|Hell yes!!|We would all die sooner or later and we would help give back nature what we took from it yeah seems fair after what humans have done to earth.|Oh hell Yeah i want a tree grave|Absolutely|And then we would have ghosts......|Weed plant will grow on mine|yeah!|Of course i wanna live forever in that tree|That is so clever. It looks better and helps the enviorment. Double win|How do we make this a “thing”?|So just fuck those who died in ww1 and ww2|imagine instead of gravestones we put dildo up my ass|The dead persons atoms go into the tree|I just imagine a lot of uprooted graves caused by literal tree roots. I’m unsure if that would be the case though|Once I die I'm gonna be buried in a simple wooden box and put under a flower bed not sure of what yet but something cool with flowers for bees and butterflies and what-not|And on the trees we can carve the name and other information about them!|This is an old tradition in South Slavic cultures that was practiced until mid 20th century trees were planted on top of young children who didnt survive the childhood. It might sound morbid but the children remain remembered for generations|It costs around 5000€ to 6000€ in Germany to get a tree instead...|No that’s disrespectful to the people who died you selfish prick|Do not click on my profile. (You will regret it) 😱😱😱|Yes👏|We do this in kenya|Yaes|pretty disrespectful|Best way to save the world for your love ones😍😍👍|As long as it wasn’t a monoculture like in the picture!|Doesn't fucking matter what your thoughts are ideas like this stay as ideas because yall too lazy to actually do anything|Bad idea|It doesn’t make any sense to not do it|Yes|???|Ok but how would you know which is your loved one?|It still would not replace lost rainforest habitat.  We're screwed.  #1decadeleft 💀💀|Hear me out .... cremate everyone and use the land for oh idc ... THE LIVING|Biodegradable caskets don't embalm. (Not everyone can accept cremation.)|At least I’d be able to piss on the tree and not get arrested. Let’s do it.|I would love my corpses to be a tree|No. I don't want to be used as tree food nor do I want my loved ones. It's a Disgrace to even consider the thought.|🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ yes let do this|@justinaj_keeper01|Na I’m just joking I know I really think it’s a great idea|Yes!!!!🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳|Follow @centralorganix for nature-based content and biodegradable products🌱🌱🌱|Uh so what about the name of the fucken lost ones and special quotes etc|Then we would cut down graves|So great idea yes but now I'm just thinking about creepy haunted forests instead of cemeteries|I want u to imagine ur ded grandma with roots growing through her|Agree.  Instead we dig up the ground for granite|🙌👏|“Yeah so I always remember grandma with this pad of paper”|Love it|Yes!!!|Yesssssass|It would look nice and it wouldn’t look as scary either also you can hug the tree 🥺|Cool 🙌🏼|Tbh love this idea I think it would be beautiful to have a forest dedicated to this and each family can decorate their families tree|It’s like beautiful the soul of a person can live through the tree metaphorically and like you could decorate it for Christmas etc|I think it’s a good idea but how to know who is who?|I don’t think it would work because like what if my great grandchildren would come see me they wouldn’t really know which ‘grave’ is mine|Yeah it would be too packed and the trees wouldn't survive. Also who is who?|This is gonna sound crazy but we actually can't. Because of all the bad stuff we ingest now adays our decomposing bodies would actually be harmful to the plants and eventually kill them. Good idea in theory kind of a mess in practice.|Although it may not help deforestation I think it’s a good idea. We as humans think we are special. I’m not you’re not get over it. This planet was here long before us and will be long after. You can use me as fertilizer idgaf. 😂|No|I love it|I wanna b a tree|@noellesestakk|Yeah this is a good idea kinda but then again the roots will grow and spread out underground. We could also have names engraved on the tree|Some countries have actually done this|In Germany are designated forest areas where your ashes can be buried under a tree|The human body makes a great fertilizer😝|Yes! Yes! Yes!|Yes!|no|Agree|I wanna be a tree :0|#Regram repost|#repost|No|It’s a fantastic idea. In fact I have seen many places in Poland doing this... it’s absolutely beautiful!|My grandma died a few days ago and i told my mum the idea of planting a tree in her memory. She really liked trees....|We would have to worry about deforestation bc you can only put so many bodies in the ground due to space needed. If we plant trees w/ ashes of loved ones instead of their bodies this would work. :) Also trees need space for roots to grow.|Nah|Not a good idea it’s a great idea|Actually yes|It’s actually a great idea! When do we start!!😂|Imagine if i didnt have to read idiotic posts like this. Holy shit fuck insta|Hunted forest 🌳 🤣|Damm  if we do this we gone have alot of trees planted after September 21st|What if one day your going to visit and the there is no tree cause someone cut it down and it won’t stop someone from cutting down trees|Great idea 💡 💚|👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽|Amazing idea !|There's an old Quaker graveyard that someone of my family are buried in that's kinda like that|It is a fantastic idea|Agreed!!!!!!!!!!!!👍💯|@anthony94aj mau gni klo die|I feel like graves should definitely be marked in some way but I think it’s a very sweet idea|that’s a pretty cool idea !|And make a haunted forest? Hell no i aint gonna go an put flowers on my relatives graves in a foggy dark haunted forest.|That’s a good idea but how would you know what tree your relatives were buried under|with our ashes 🥰|Yes we should do this|Except that trees don't grow on graves!🙄|the problem is that trees take up to much space the idea is great but its hard to make it|Or instead of burying under the tree i heard of this thing where you can acrually use the ashes to make a tree|Hi 👋🏼 sorry to bother you but me and my friends are working on a project for school and we need help spreading the awareness around for ocean pollution 😊🙏🏼 if you could fff... Maybe a s/o? 😂😂😂 We are needing as much help as possible 💕 thank you ☺️❤️|Hell yea|The only problem is that we would run out of space|I would rather see a forest than a cemetary.|The tree would eat the bodies of our loved ones|maybe keep a pedestal at the bottom of the tree. or maybe once the tree is grown crave the person's name into it|I know that in some countries they add a tree on top of the ashes so the tree gets the nutrients from there. Nice idea. The circle of life. That’s exactly how I want to be buried.|I want my tombstone to stick out of the bottom of the tree kind of like the Buddha statue in the bottom of the tree|Tombstones are sentimental to some people. If given the choice of a tree yes. But if someone wants to have a tombstone that should be respected.|It’s a good idea but how would we actually know who’s tree is whose they don’t have names on and also what about if a fire starts all the graves are gone or if a tree falls down loads of ‘graves’ would be destroyed so like it’s good for the environment but we would have to be careful about it|✨💖👏|Great idea|🙌🙌|People are just dumb af|Omg giving them new life I kinda love that|Why dont we have a tree and a tombstone?|They rent that places ..|The trees could have wooden signs on them with info about the dead person?|*tries to go visit cousins grave*.... ""Which tree was it again...""|Love this! 💕 what a beautiful way to honor both your loved ones and the planet at the same time 🌸|It's what in having when I die no tombstone just a conker tree|This already exists I live in Germany and we have both a graveyard and a forest where people’s ashes get buried and then they plant a tree on top of it|This would be a very bad idea because if one grave-tree got a disease then hundreds of other grave-trees would have to be get cut down|Fabulous idea. Why aren’t we doing this.❤️|Maybe if they put the tombstones in front of the tree people might still want to go visit and bring flowers. But it seems like it would spread diseases so idk. 💀|It’s a nice thought but they’d be too big|pretty genius but dont graves get removed After some Time?|My thoughts are I need to plant more trees 🌳🌴🌴🌲 We are planting 1 tree for every 1 follow. Check us out follow and we will plant a tree @1follow.1tree #1follow1tree|Holy sacred forest. Put some stones on it too|Trees need room around them to grow we don’t have the room for it. What should be done is banning embalming and make getting cremated the only option|There are 7 billion people in earth right now. Not everyone is fitting in a grave and it’s time we address this|Holy sacred forest. Put some stones on it too|Imma have this as my death wish|Just get cremated and be mad into a tree|Perfect idea!|Woow.|It wouldn't be as uniform and tameable. People want to visit their dead loved ones. It would be pretty hard to find which tree is your grandma...|People wouldn't have it|Realistically speaking|I wanna be Willow. 😊|It would be less depressing going to grave yards|You can make me into a weed plant|🙌|@dancing_paws|@zachdowdall the FBI is onto us|But... thats. no that wouldnt...|I think that could be quite special. You can nail a plack to the trunk and say anything u would like to. I actuslly no someone who has done this xxxx|That's a really good idea 👏👏|I believe it would work bc the trees would just root around the coffins like they do gates and fences. The only thing is they might have to leave bodies of ppl whose murders haven't been solved alone in case they want to exhume them.|Opp|I think it’s a great idea... it wouldn’t solve deforestation though...|Probs cheaper than a gravestone|I’m my yesss for sure 10/10|I’m my yesss for sure 10/10|Yes because a plant is new life too❤️|It is cute i would like a cherry tree|Everyone liked that|@kiraellaa wdyt???|@methpincer|tapi aku mikir juga wktu liat makam2 di jawa kan luas2 bnget ya.. coba diganti pohon juga pasti keren sih..|Why dont we do that?|They do this in toowoomba qld. It's beautiful.|Idk if I commented on this exact post before but no not really first people would have to stop pumping corpses full of chemicals 😒|Sounds like a good idea|My grandparents have trees where they’re buried they’re called green burials and I want one when I die. A big oak tree!|When I die I want to turn into ashes and then nourish a tree that will be planted instead of my grave.|imagine how much space that would waste|Whoa great idea but at night that place will be a ghosty jungle😂|But the roots might suffocate the skeleton but good idea|yknow room and culture bc some cultures like having gravestones|haunted forest xD|I like this|They already have these urn options you’re ashes get mixed into pre seeded biodegradable cups and turn into trees|lets plant trees behind epitaphs:)|Would the land be protected? What if someone needed to cut the tree down for easement. Or the tree got sick or died and needs to b cut down. How would the families handle it after visiting the tree (memorial for their child) for decades but city needs to cut it down? Granite blocks r more sustainable considering the reasoning. However that shouldn't stop us from planting trees.|Yes this is a beautiful idea it's like as though you live on through your tree!!!|70% of recycling of air is done by the oceans not trees|Uh yeah this should've been done a long time ago|Do you have any idea what cemetery that is... If not I don't need to say anything else|Graves are honestly a waste of space and honestly? It’s just a dead person. Doesn’t matter if they’re buried in a super fancy casket or something unless it’s like a super important figure or something like a ruler. Not only that but planting trees on top of buried bodies is kinda beautiful metaphorically and gives back to the planet. Maybe they could plant different trees for each grave like an Apple tree for one and a cherry tree for another.|Sounds amazing|I rate this graves are waste of resources this is much better|Yeah|I've been talking about that to my family a lot. Glad to see people agree! Graves have made me so mad for so long there's really no point. The people are dead! They won't come back and planting trees would benefit us way more than having a family visit a grave once every 10 years. I never see anybody at any of the graveyards in my city. It's ridiculous! I don't care what needs to be done to get trees planted on graveyards. Whether they have to dig up graves or not. If I were dead and burried I'd be glad they're digging me up for something more important like trees! I definitely wanna be burried in a biodegradable bag tho.|I'm putting this in my will I don't want a toomstone I want a tree|When I die I want to be buried into the ground without a casket so that my body becomes a food source for the tree beside me|Great idea|Sounds amazing!!!|Amazing idea|I WOULD LOVE MY GRAVESTONE TO BE A MF TREE|i want my spirit in a tree|we could name the trees after the people under them omg 🥺|I want my grave to be a weeping willow|Very good thought|how would u know whos body is under the trees my dude|It seems to me that no one here understands that funerals are rituals that have a long meaningful history for humans. Doesnt matter what ethnicity or nation. Rituals give us a sense of meaning purpose and do something intangible for us... and among them the funeral is probably the most important bc no one can say for sure what happens to people when they die. This would be a nice option for those who want it but will not become a widespread thing bc the sense of tradition in funerals matters to those mourning. It seems as though few commenters have lost a close loved one. It is someone you love... like i lost my father... lowering his casket into the ground was awful... like you were leaving him alone in the cold ground. So the idea of tree roots growing through him would be more than i could take. Please remember that funerals are for the living... to help them cope with loss. Of all the things on the planet needing change for the environment i doubt our means of burials is really a pressing issue|plant the trees and put ashes into the tree underneath...ashes help with planting and they actually turn into seeds...if we die and put our ashes into the ground...beautiful plants can grow...once humans who breath laugh love and learn....turning into another life that helps us all....when I die i would love nothing but to be turned into a life that can still help the people living still flourish in their lifetime|Imagine unironically thinking that this would actually work|This would be cool cause you could sit in the tree of a lost loved one and read.|But then trees would have souls in them|As much as I love trees the grave stones are there for people who left like no one would be able to go to their relivtave. Like ww1 and ww2 fighters they have certain graves and it shows history 2|Great idea|Great idea|love this|Yes|No.|yea i better bury beside whatever the tree..|it’s not like the fucking tree root will pierce through the corpse of your dead mom or anything|Yeah we did this with my grandmother and put her ashes beneath a fig tree we planted now every time I have a fig from that tree I commemorate her❤️❤️|I feel like we could plant trees over them but also have a sign or something to state who resides at the grave|no bc trees need more than 6 feet of room for roots usually|This isn’t the same but there’s a protected graveyard near my house and it is basically in and mixed with a forest so it looks natural and the deer come with their babies and they play on the gravestones. It’s actually so beautiful there and makes me rlly happy.|It could be really great ❤️ But a tree needs more space than a grave tomb|Yes!|It’s gone be roots growing through yo loved ones😂|It’s gone be roots growing through yo loved ones😂|And then you can carve the names and other things on the tree :D|💯👍|Idk what effects it would have in total but diseases and bacteria would have to be a huge factor in this. You can’t just plant a living thing on top of something that is rotting and has many diseases on it.|That’s great idea!!|I think it’s beautiful !!!|Awesome idea|I’d rather be grown into a tree than have a rock on my grave ❤️|The roots will actually end up pushing the dead bodies up over the years and eventually they won’t be buried anymore so I think a better alternative is just to turn the body itself into a tree which is something you can do and what I plan on doing|I mean it don't sound bad 😳|The “never worry about deforstation” is FUCKING bullshit|Love it!!!|Its fucking stupid how is planting tress on tombstones going to do anything about deforestation people are just gonna cut them down|So basically it would mean to transform all graveyards in forests? That wouldn’t be very much space.|👏👏👏👏Good idea|Yes 100%|Yep|No the dead could possess the trees|But send the Elected Officials (AKA) government to war instead of us voters|New wave🌊 I want a tree for my grave so much more peaceful 🌲🌲💎❗|Everyone should do this|@icedmagnitude|Every state should do this !!|Amazing|that's retarded|Love this 💕|So how would you know who’s who|A lot of people wouldn't like that because they visit the grave constantly or that's the main connection to that person that and trees need a proper amount of light and nutrients to grow properly so the best option is to plant a tree over the grave after like 100-150 years that way the trees will most likely be more spaced and the family will be more okay with it|That would be amazing and each person's ashes could be barried with the tree seed and a plaque could be drilled into the tree|umm... no?|Omg is this an education about earth account? Know the difference between forests and planting trees. Stupid account talking to stupid people|wait you could plant trees then plant a tree as a grave stone then still put one infinity of the tree|@bruh.i.like.cows yeah your right|i love this idea! i wanna do it when i die|My grandpa was buried in a place where each grave is given a small name plate and a tree planted to mark it. It was the nicest graveyard I have been to particularly because of the lack of gravestones|It’s really gd|muslims already did it|Trees will drink up our water and we will die of dehydration.|In my country we already did it since wayyyy before.|And its roots get into our bodies so we will become part of the trees 😊|it’s nice because it can represent- nvm y’all don’t care 💀|haunted forest huh|people and their corpse containers are weird|@asweet3529 and this is why I want to be a tree lol.|IVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOREVER it’s actually such a good solution when you think abt it. please spread this|It's a great idea. It's cost effective  pretty  environmentally friendly and is just nice in general ❤️|as long as there's enough space and enough people watering (and raking and trimming!) then i think it's a good idea.|we'd also have haunted forests and the roots would mangle people's skeletons but it sounds like an adventure|Terrible idea|Disrespectful to the soldiers who have died in those graveyards simply because their name would be forgotten|Say sike rn|What the fuck|Say sike|I want myself to return to the earth. Fuck a coffin|Until the roots dig through your coffin|If you want give them all a tree with their name on it be respectful please|y’all know your ashes can be turned into seeds right??? like fuck yes this is a fucking great idea imo|What about plants instead|Only 2 issues with that. 1 being that there's probably not enough soace for instance look at the trees in the background. 2 the names would most likely be forgotten depending on how it's done. Otherwise it's a cool idea|I love this idea|What about stopping encasing caskets in concrete? Takes so much fossil fuels to create concrete and it prevents us from breaking down naturally back into the ecosystem|Plant trees and put a drift wood of who it is|I think this is really nice but where would the roots grow into?|Imagine NOT NEEDING MILITARY CEMETERIES THAT BIG? Wouldnt THAT be awesome?|They used to do this. All the time. 💚|I wanna be a cactus when I die|Some of y’all really talking nonsense. Talking about they would be forgotten if anything they can have a headstone with their names but they’re ashes should be mixed with dirt so it can plant the seed. Makes it seem like they’re still living in a way.|i want this when i die|Ya if you want the skeleton to come out when the roots grow bigger|More trees more animals more life in a rather dead and sad place|Muslims in my country already did that years ago until present time|I think this is a beautiful idea! 💚|People plant pine trees in front of gravestones in my country|I think we  should do this💚|Woah creepy cemetery Forrests would be cool|Yes yes yes !!!!!!|That’s retarded🤦🏾‍♂️. People getting out of hand🤣🤣|Great idea!|There's actually a program where you can use your ashes to plant a tree|That’s actually a great idea|YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES 💓💓💓💓🙏|What kind of tree can grow & prosper when planted with that kind if density? The growth area for limbs would be confined quite tightly|Yeah this is a great idea|This is what I'm gonna do when I die and plus it would be so much more comforting to walk in a forest than cold tombstones|Yes but we need to stop deforstering as well. I read today that Brasil removes three football fields of forests each minute... We have to stop that too! Because the rain forest we have are better than trees that have to grow first.|They wouldn't even all fit|There is accually a company that does this|And carve stuff on the trees about the perspn who died☺️|What about the roots? Wouldn't they interfere with the coffin?|Yes!|Yes would work super well|Yeah I geuss it could work but what happens when too many people die and we have to plant too many trees like we would have to desicrate someones grave to stop us from drowning in tress|Also I just thought of something trees need carbon to make oxygen so we have to have some pollution to have tress|@annimiya 🤯|Thats how you get scary ghost forrests tho😂|why not become cremated and plant your ashes along with a tree? have a bunch of dead bodies in the ground is just weird to me. becoming a part of the earth sound a whole lot better if you ask me|Jess|Let’s do it👌🏻|Duh yess|If I die I don’t want a tree|Yes|I'm for it yes|Amazing|Ya it's a pretty good way to disrespect those we love|how u gon find ur family bro etch it on the tree in 10 years???|Think about all the types of trees there are we could do fruit trees and flowering trees that could be hotspots for pollinators|Nice idea. Good if we all follow.|what if the tree dies|Better not be the same type of tree tho cause mono cultures are bad|I think it’s one of the best ideas I have ever heard|It would be so beautiful|I dnt know. A mix of them why not but the trees die and even though some of them stay for centuries then it’s just gone for the presence of the person it may have had on Earth|The roots would go into the coffin tho|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|And bury me au naturale in a mushroom spore suit instead of embalmed in a coffin so I can turn into nutrients for the earth ASAP 🍄✨|what aré tombstone?|yes!!!|So how did this tree grow so big what fertilizer did you use? -My grandma|Omg yes and it’s graves so they’d never be cut down...right??|yes PLEASE|Honestly I don’t wanna be remembered on some dumb stone lol a tree would be waaaaaay cooler honestly and helpful|I would rather just be thrown into the trash instead of making my family pay thousands of dollars for a dumb funeral. What are they gonna do? Dig out my body to say hi or something? Lol|Genius|Cemeteries would be a lot more comfortable and visiting passed ones would be pleasant and good practice! And we would save the world|Getting away with murder would be easier|@25mg_melperon|When someone die should plant a tree instead of the white thing? Sorry i didnt get the idea|Not over the grave. A tree's roots are the same size as the height of the tree. So six feet under wouldnt work. And the tree's would get tangled together since they're so close together which will cause quite a few problems. Maybe plant a tree somewhere else not over the grave|How about both hmm|in order to make burials better ppl shld first stop using embalming fluids or whatever. nd if ur interested look into green burials! there’s also another idea that I’m not sure has been realised yet but it consists of putting a body in a pod and using that as nutrients for trees|Yes|This would be amazing plus I feel like people would feel more happy to visit loved ones💗|Wonderful idea|No because people have died for great things and people want to remember them and it would be very disrespectful and most cemeteries are by cities it by a town so it would be very hard and where would be put the rest of the body’s|Omg yea|I also had that idea and also the grave yard would be more happy and a place to celebrate someone's life and more green! 💚💚💚💚 i really hope they will start doing this!|Yes|And the names and stuff abt them was engraved in the tree!!|@ghebert9 seeee|Incredible idea and such a beautiful tribute to those passed on. My sons father passed when he was 11 yrs old I purchased a tree from the Guelph Aboretum as a dedication to his father. The bonus is we get to visit and know his Dad is there with us. Such a gift for my son 💗|Definitely not a good idea. This is a federal/military cemetery.|There are companies that mix in cremated remains with tree soil.|I saw it in a book series called keeper of the lost cities|Where do I sign|👍🏼why not put the stone at the bottom of the tree|i don’t wanna die n become a tree|Imagine walking through a forest with a plaque on every tree just like a tombstone and your children being able to climb a tree that was a  greatgrandparent. Instead of talking to a piece of stone you can talk to a living tree that will live for hundreds of years as the tombstones start to deteriorate. Imagine future generations visiting your family/grove of trees. Connecting nature with spirit just seems right.|When I die pls make me a tree. That is my only wish.|Should be the person who died choice|I think it's a good idea🌎😃|I think it's a good idea🌎😃|Please go away|My dad wants this to happen to him and it’s happened to many people in my family on their request and I want the same i want to be part of nature|This is great just have a small plaque that says their names and nothing to long or fancy 
Love this idea|At least in Germany forest grave yards do exist. Some people find them too anonymous tho|@zaramasyhurah you know what I want from now on|FABULOUS IDEA!!! 👏👏👏|Perfect idea - not only very ""useful"" these days but also beautiful and meaningful in my opinion.|Haunted forest|Ok but have you ever had to walk in that cemetery^ it’s so long and too many hills man i was tired😭|that would be perfect!! i would suggest using our/their remains as compost but that may be too far for some people haha|Omg this genius|They already have some kind of ""forest cemeteries"" in some parts of Germany (I knew of one in Bavaria near Coburg). But there are several persons burried under one tree not necessary from the same family depends on how much ""you"" would like to pay for ""your"" grave. If I remember correctly it's was rather (!) expensive though.|Have you come across Burial Pods ? Designed by an Italian (of course). Brilliant idea|Yes!|check out @lucybiggers video on green funerals! 🌱🙌|this is honestly such a good idea!!|Its a awesome idea but i dont think many people will be keen to the idea|Dope|I’ve said this for years|The materials that make up coffins aren’t good for the ground either. The bodies themselves are good fertiliser. The dead don’t need to be buried in comfort... they’re already dead|Carve the names of the dead into the tree|I mean... If you want to go for it but it is the last choice you will ever make and people prefer traditional headstones- don't force them.|Yes|Old lives come back into the earth helping the new ones|I think it's brilliant but if someone does not like it then don't force them|they do this in ireland and it is absolutely lovely|Yeah but it shouldnt be forced|lol they can do it for mine|In Romania there was a custom of planting a tree at the head/feet of the grave along with a tombstone. Too bad modern day ""too scared to see my loved ones dead"" took a toll on the custom...|And what if you could choose what kind of tree was planted for you? It’d be beautiful!|The best idea 🙌🙌🙌|What is this world coming too?|Great idea but we would still have to worry about deforestation. Cemeteries are definitely not one of the leading causes of deforestation|In other countries instead of having cemeteries they feed the dead bodies to these big ass birds 🐦 I saw a video of them feeding their love ones to birds the dead bodies were kids and adults I find it wrong|I’ve deff thought of that too!!! Great idea 😍|That actually sounds kinda cool like imagine hanging a little wood sign with the persons name and shit on a branch and people could plant whatever type of tree they want like a cherry blossom or some shiz|The idea i get plant trees do good kinda thing but what if the roots just end up pushing the bodies out of the ground ? Roots r large and 6 ft isn’t much to a massive oak tree so and also it would always be really dark and cold there cos the trees would block out the light and when trees don’t have leaves it’s cold anyway 🤷‍♂️😂😂|Yesss|good ideayess|This is real my grandpa was buried like this|And that’s how you create haunted forests 😂 but cool idea it’s much better than graves|Yessssss|Trees instead of new graves but planting trees on existing graves is disrespectful|After you die you still grow and contribute to the rest of the world in a different way you couldn’t before with oxygen|*groot stabs dead man in heart by acceidnt*|Agree👏|❤️❤️❤️🙌🏼|This doesn’t stop us having to worry about deforestation they will still destroy forests and animals habitats which is he main reason we want it to stop|Superb idea!!! Circle of life🌍|Yes!|I buried my grandma under a tree|Yeahhh amaxing idea|Deep I like this idea.|Yes|Very interesting|No|This is extremely disrespectful but okay go off|It’s a pretty idea. Would be cool if you could have a choice.|It’s a pretty idea. Would be cool if you could have a choice.|It's a great idea.|LOVE IT 😍|everyone wants to be buried under a tree 😳|Bury me under a tree - wow|Tombs are expensive as fuck anyway|👍|✅|I love this idea. It would be more meaningful to visit a living thing than lifeless stone.|Love this ... I would want a Willow Tree ....|I think this would make some families feel better bc it's like their relative is still living but in a different form 🤷‍♀️ a tree is much happier than a stone just saying peeps!|But christian graves are renewed after some times :S|This is a really good idea🙌🌿|My grandparents village did that for everyone who served in the wars. It’s on tops of “memorial hill” and it’s super pretty.|I completely agree. “Vegetation is the basic instrument the Creator uses to set all of nature in motion” Antoine Lavoisier|Or instead of graves just have walls with peoples ashes|I mean sure sis|The crosses back in ancient times were made of wood and in twenty years a tree from that wood will grow. Cement changed the way people die... The essence of life in the body remains doesnt get turned into the trees nutrition where life takes place in another form.|Yesss|And carve the names of le dead people|thats hella smart|Also there's a thing called burning peoples ashes. So we dont have to bury bodies and waste space|YEAH!|❤️❤️❤️|Lol do you see what most Alive humans are doing to nature? What on earth makes you think they get better when dead? Chances are the biggest assholes (egoistic) and most evil people on this planet probably already picked their tombs and coffins to make sure their physical body will be “protected” once buried given how selfish and “special” they think they are compared to the rest of the universe. But I do love the idea for all the nature lovers that want to contribute to this beautiful planet by donating their physical body back once used for a lifetime 🙏🏽❤️|In odisha we have a place called smrutibana which is literally forest planted in memory of someone. We usually have plants of our ancestors plus we have crematorium grounds so not much pollution on that ground|Great idea!!!!!! I d like my tombstone to be a tree|We Turkish have ancient believe and we plant cypress trees front and back side of our buried relatives... This belief comes from pre-islamic old Turkish religion ""Göktengri"" means God lives in the skyland... And this trees help their souls to climb to heaven...|I think it’s more meaningful trees has more feelings then a stone|This is a wonderful idea! Who wouldn't love having a tree as their headstone? 👍🙌👏|Haunted forest|I think it's something we should think ot|Of*|I wanna do that thing where your ashes get turned into seeds|I love this idea. Cemeteries take up so much space. Sitting under a  tree to talk to your loved one sounds nice.|Yes I AGREE|Too much retards commenting here without the knowledge about the topic.... It's said that if you plant a tree on someones grave.... It'll become a curse and the person won't rest in peace & will haunt the place or the tree...|I think thats a wonderful idea!!|That’s would be amazing|Imagine how scary it would be at night😂 but other then that it’s a nice idea|Maybe we should think abt turning all the filthy slums around the world into forest. Please come and help me clean my country Indonesia people are littering everywhere :(|👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻|WOW I really think this should happen.|We prefer death|How would we know which tree is whose|I think this should be the next big thing|🙌🏽|Where were you all these years...|In Naples exists!|Love!  If I died I would love to know I contributed to something that was still alive.|Yeah but you have those dumbasses asking"" BuT hOw WiLl I rEmEmBeR tHeM""|Awesome idea|There are places in NZ that do this here’s the link https://diamondharbour.info/eco-burials/ 😁|Yessssss|Dead people=fertilizer 😳|Plant a tree over my grave and let my spirit rest und it's calming shadows before the angels come and guide me into the next life|Yea  your 100% right ! Next step  I plan on using my body as fertilizer for a tree . I never liked the idea of cemeteries but I  did like the idea of having a resting place for my love ones to visit me at. Much rather a beautiful tree then a hunk is concrete !|I want a cherry tree over my grave 🌸❤️|Yeah!!! Amen!!!|I love this but given that animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation worldwide unfortunately planting trees with one hand while bulldozing the existing ones with the other is a sisyphean task. Until we tackle the cultures that glorify gluttony and greed (the underbelly of a consumer driven society) our relationship with nature shall remain the same.|That sounds like a good idea and the people that cut the trees can’t do anything about it because there’s an actual person in there and have to deal with lawsuits if they want to cut down the trees|Why not do both plant the tree and place a name plate on or by it!|Or it will be a haunted forest|I’ll get a tree onto my grave|Yeah that’s just fine|I always dream about a cemetery where instead make a plaque we go to “sleep in peace” with a tree seed inside of us waiting for grow in a while we discompose. What do you think?|I think it's a fantastic idea👏👏👏|Absolutely|Awesome!|yesss|Please sign and share my petition to ban food waste in the UK|Great idea!|I do this for my dogs!|Please do this when I die. Who wants to be remembered with a brick? Why not a beautiful tree? Give back to the world you lived in. Sounds lovey.|I plan to be a maple tree.|Checkout the livingurn.com|@livingurn|Yesss|Thetreesremember.com|Yahh|❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️|It's a great idea❤️❤️|a dedicated tree instead|It could be really cool too!|Which tree belongs to who tho|Please bury me under a tree and please I don’t care if anyone knows it was my body|YES|Please bury me under a tree I’d like to be something amazing and helpful once I die like a tree|Love it|No|We might also have haunted forests. But a small price to pay I think.|I’ve always wanted to be buried under a tree. I’m pretty sure it’s illegal though.|I hope to be buried under a tree one day|if u choose the tree u want to be under that will be cool it's like choosing your tree instead of a gravestone. Cause a lot of people don't seem to like the idea.|It would be amazing to have a specific tree or plant that's good for the environment that you picked with maybe a small card made of cement that reads the tombstone part say this (plant) was dedicated to (persons name) and then have their grave information|Beautiful idea!|its a super idea👌🏼|Superb idea whoever thought of this|Ain’t having roots growing all thru my body lol|Maybe next to👌|It wouldn't be very effective though since the beginning of humanity there has been around 100 billion humans on Earth. Or we would need way more trees to counter deforestation|Amazing idea 👏🏻. Best I’ve heard in a long time|yes! what a great idea. graveyards would look so much nicer and it doesn't have to be one tree for one body. i don't like how many cultures (including mine) handle death so i think connecting it to life growth and nature would be nice ☺|Personally I like it very much!!! I love nature!!! 😍😍😍|Of course 💪|Amazing idea! When can we get started?|👍👍|I’m all for it. Great way to remember those we’ve lost 👍🏼|Great idea! Let’s do it 👍🏻|l love it!  l would much rather visit my momma while sitting under a tree rather than sitting in the hot sun❤️|Great!|InshaALLAH I ill do in my country|@zeinshaikh_ @ali_arif_051|I want a tree. No rocks here.🙌🙌|Do you want haunted forests? Cuz that's how you get haunted forests.|@saidehomsi 🌳 Same idea|And stopped using embalming fluids laid to rest in a basket. We thrn become fertilizer to keep the cycle going. I'm very grateful I live in a part of the USA that has natural cemetaries. It gives me peace knowing I will help the circle of lufe.|I know someone who wants to be buried under a tree maybe the government could cover the cost of the funeral whole funeral for the family under the condition they use a  tree?|Yeah but when you go to a relatives grave it’ll be a bit creepy being in a haunted forest full of graves|👍 Great Idea!|Love this!!|We worry about deforestation becasue it destroyes eco systems. If the gravestone would be a tree it would help reduce takeaway some carbon from the atmosphere but it wont restore eco systems. What a dumb post|@selimsaade|A tree will be over me!!|This is amazing you can just hang up a sign😍🌳|Yes!|Amazing idea👍🌳|And u can put a plaque on it it would be beautiful|#Dumbest #human #civilizatiom|A tree in their honor|Brilliant|Also wouldnt the decomposing body act as a source of nutrients so even after death people are fueling something beautiful (might not be 100% accurate i havent double checked that)|This is how we do in Russia|I must say the people who past away would rather have a tree planted for them with fruit to share so they will be aible to give what they were fighting for. A free and fruitful abundance live for all children of the world.|I will never understand wasting so much space for the dead. It's stupid. This is the best idea ever. ❤️🤘|Terrible idea. That would be disrespectful to the dead|Yes yes yes... ♥️|I really want to be under or have my ashes used in the growing of trees at least to me it is more comforting to hug a tree and feel its being than the emptiness of a tombstone... I don’t know what my grandfather would have thought and of course I’d respect his decision but what I’d give to hug something that would feel like him hugging me back.|Erm... 🤔... GENIUS!|For each human it implicates in  average of 65 year 7.2 billion trees 😆7.200000000 x 7.2 x 7.2 = 7.3^3x10^9 is a huge forest 😆😆|Yes 💚 this would be life after death 🙌🏻|And we would carve their names on the tree!!!! Yess this is such a great idea! Saving the world even after death 🌍|Or we could just burn the body’s so when winter comes we don’t have to worry about them coming back 🤷🏼‍♀️|find that a better way to honor someones death - even name the tree after that person 👏🏽|This is an amazing idea 🙌❤️|What a good idea 💚|Excellent idea and unlikely to ever be felled as its a ""grave""|@princess_fizzy_dizzy  I want a tree|Good idea though we would definitely need a huge land for the grave|@susemaguse|Better!|I do think that is a good idea|this is an amazing idea|It’s an amazingggg idea 🤩🤩🤩|It's a very food idea!|But there would be more chance of the trees catching fire and then  all the people (even though they are dead)would be burnt🌳🔥❌|Roots ? 😳  What about drought and fire?  Identification? Upkeep? Sounds like a wonderful money maker for the Under Takers . 🧟‍♂️
We can make the coffins biodegradable and fill them with Miracle Grow.
Green New Deal ✌️🤡🌈|YES!|Yup!|We do it in Indonesia|So much nicer to remember the ones we love under a tree|My nanny is buried in a green cemetery full of beautiful trees and wild flowers. She has a marker and we visit. There is a place to sit amongst the trees and all you hear is birdsong!  I’m wanting a biodegradable coffin and buried in a green cemetery in Scotland with no marker. Peace amongst trees 💖|Yeaaahh... i wish one day .. everyoane agreed on that 🌳🌲🌲🌳|Great idea!!! The best one👍👍👍👍|Totally should|👍|Yes trees instead of headstones perfect|I do. Why not|That would be such a great idea rlly💪🏻|Yes|❤️|Yes|Yes|Yes|Always wanted this when the time comes 🌳|Let’s do it. ✌🏻|yes every tree can be the name of someone who we love him😍😍😍|Love The idea|Love love💖|We do it in Russia. Old cemeteries in my city pretty much look like a forest|Trees with carved in names??|🌊👌|@jjmiracle|Yes!|Sounds like a wonderful idea|absolutely 💞|I think this is a beautiful idea 😍|😃👍❤️|Such a good idea!!|Forest would require higher labor to keep it in order think about bad storms could knock tree down.... Maybe a rosemary|SII|Where tf u gonna put the bodies|👏|👌|🙌|Yess 🙌|Yes|Genius|What if on top of every sky scraper there was a rooftop garden|I swear I’ve read about a company that turns ashes into soil for trees and then you can plant the tree or something like that. I like this concept|Great idea!|👍👏🙌|Such a great idea. Anyone could have to have a favourite tree that would be planted in honour of them.|That's a superb idea|Brilliant brilliant idea|Great idea I love this.  Maybe just a plaque on the tree itself for those who really want to stay traditional?|We also write and leave messages to those that passed....|Yes wonderful idea!|Bitch wht|great idea 👍|Can’t think of anything better than a tree to mark where someone has been laid to rest.|Can’t think of anything better than a tree to mark where someone has been laid to rest.|I love this idea. Woodland burials are already available in the UK but would be great if more people considered this. A lovely legacy.|Tombstones are a way of respecting the dead. What the fuck is wrong with you. Why can’t we have tombstones and trees. Are we out of land or something|Fab idea x|Yes! I want to be a tree. And nothing to stop there being both or an inscription there too. Maybe more land would be made available for burial purposes if this was the case too.|All about it!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼|Yes|Yes!!❣️|YES 🙌|I think it’s a wonderful idea they could put plaques up on the trees to remember who the person was❤️",31736

You know what! Mars doesn’t have any freakin trees. Just why do you wanna go then. Barron red planet|So true. We can simply fix the planet 🌎. Food for thought 💭 do you know that the man behind Mars One is not funded by the government. So they have all of these applicants/participants with 1 way tickets to Mars with absolutely no chance of return. Fast forward - this guy dies the funding stops .. government turns a blind eye. People should really think and investigate what they’re getting themselves into. Mars One is dead anyway.  Mars One was a small private Dutch organization that received money from investors by claiming it would use it to land the first humans on Mars and leave them there to establish a permanent human colony.[2][3][4] From its announcement in 2012 to its bankruptcy in early 2019 it is estimated to have received tens of millions of dollars.[5] The organization was not an aerospace company and did not manufacture hardware. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_One|We are transforming a paradise called earth into desert and dreaming to live in a big desert called Mars.

Someone tell me if im wrong|Cuz money there's no money to be made if we're not using Plastics|It s easy to show plaatic bottle. ... but what about all of theye plastic bag for each product what is packed in. Chips  shower gel shampoo brushes all of these suitcases in plastic bags from airports bisquits plastic windows.... give me the answer now please. The problem is that there s so many prople and wecan t stop to produce plastic because it s just inpossible. For so many reasons.the question should b now what to do with plastic and how to solve this problem with already existing plastic bags etc. Because s already starting to change life and our physical and fysical bodies.

So 🤷🏽‍♂️ plastic gives them a fighting chance|Yes or more metal than plastic|But corn or cactus or avocado s polymer means that it must b cultured more and more so it means less wood and and needs of soil. The same with paper. bamboo. It s necesatty to solve the ptoblem what to do with already existing tones of plastic the way the most ffugal nature way.

If they will acknowledge and stop persecuting the aboriginals who have been ""renewable "" for centuries|Wonderful hope it's not too late!|If you want to help the environment, allow the use of Hemp.
It can be used as energy in the forms of oil and biomass. Diesel engines can already run off of hemp oil. Vehicles can be made from hemp, reducing its weight while being 4.5x stronger than steel.
It would take around 6% of the US land for hemp to be grown to be energy independent. Hemp burns 90-95% cleaner than fossil fuels. Hemp can be a carbon negative plant (net decrease of atmospheric CO2). It can be used as building materials such as wood and concrete to create buildings and homes. Hempcrete insulates very efficiently, saving energy and leading to more affordable housing and utilities. It’s strong, resistant to pest, mold, water and fire. Hemp wood is very strong to (stronger than steel!) and grows abundantly.
We can create plastic from it and to use for all different things from cars, pipes and so on. But unlike regular plastic, it’s biodegradable.
Paper can be used from it and since it grows far faster than trees, you’re saving a lot more trees using hemp instead.
It requires little to no pesticides and cleans the soil. Hemp has been grown at Chernobyl and helped reduced the radiation in the ground.",508
