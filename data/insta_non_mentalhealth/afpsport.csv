Unheralded 5,000 metre runners Braima Suncar Dabo and shattered rival Jonathan Busby drew the biggest cheer of the World Championships on Friday after a dramatic finish to their race marked by a gesture of sportsmanship.

Both Dabo and Busby had already been lapped and were competing only for pride when their final lap drama unfolded at Doha's Khalifa Stadium.

Aruba's Busby, 33, had slowed to almost a crawl down the back straight on the last lap, lurching forward uncertainly and appearing close to collapse.
.
It was then that Guinea Bissau's Dabo came to Busby's rescue, stopping to prop up his fellow racer and leading him around the final 200 metres to the finish line.
.
With the crowd roaring them on, Busby collapsed after crossing the line and was eventually taken away in a wheelchair.

Defending champions New Zealand burnished their credentials as favourites for the Rugby World Cup with a hard-fought 23-13 win against top contenders South Africa in a blockbuster match in Yokohama on Saturday.

The impressive All Blacks cut the Springboks to ribbons during a five-minute period of dominance in the first half that earned them two converted tries, and then saw off a determined second-half fightback to register the vital Pool B win.

Before nearly 64,000 fans in Yokohama's International Stadium, the All Blacks set the game alight with the sensational scoring spree which was against the early run of play.

Until then, the Springboks had enjoyed a huge territorial advantage but were unable to cross the line and had to rely on an early Handre Pollard penalty for their only points in the first half.

In a frantically paced second half, they came within one try of regaining the lead before late penalties made the game safe for New Zealand.

France blew the Basketball World Cup wide open Wednesday by handing the United States their first loss in the competition in 13 years in their quarterfinal clash, powered by a double-double from big man Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz.

The prospect of an American exit had looked increasingly possible after the USA sent a squad of second-tier stars and the loss is likely to prompt soul-searching in USA basketball.

Rafael Nadal crashed to Fabio Fognini in the Monte Carlo Masters semi-finals on Saturday, the Spanish clay court king swept aside 6-4, 6-2, to end his bid for a 12th title.

The shock result leaves Italian 13th seed Fognini facing unseeded Serb Dusan Lajovic in Sunday's unscripted final.

Fognini, who beat Nadal three times all on clay in 2015, stopped a 25-set win streak in the principality for the world number two.

.
Football legend Pele told Kylian Mbappe on Tuesday that he believes the French World Cup winner can emulate his own achievement of scoring 1,000 career goals.
.
The 78-year-old Brazilian claims to have netted over 1,000 goals in his career, while Mbappe has so far managed 103 in total, with 92 of those coming at the top level.
.
""It's possible, I scored exactly 1,025, so 1,000 goals is possible for him,"" Pele told AFP in Paris, where he met Mbappe at a sponsor event for Hublot watches.
.
Mbappe, who last year became only the second teenager to score in a World Cup final after Pele in France's 4-2 victory over Croatia, played down Pele's comments.
.
""I think that even if we count the goals on inter-city pitches and goals on the PlayStation, I won't be able to reach the 1,000-goal mark,"" said the 20-year-old Paris Saint-Germain forward.
.
""We will try to get as close as we can, but I think I'll be a long way off it at the end of my career.""
.
Mbappe has scored 32 goals in all competitions for PSG this season, including 27 from only 24 Ligue 1 appearances.
.
Pele was only 21 when he won his second World Cup in 1962, adding a third eight years later.
.
""There's only one 'King' and he's there,"" said Mbappe. ""I'm just Kylian, I'm trying to do my best to help my team and my national side.
.
""The comparisons are flattering but I know very well that I will never do what he did.""",pele mbappe,|👏👏👍👍|@k.mbappe Très bonne réponse ! Reste humble et continue à donner le meilleur de toi et le temps dira si tu bats un jour les records du roi Pelé !,308

Mikaela Shiffrin capped her phenomenal season with victory in the giant slalom at the World Cup finals in Soldeu on Sunday for her 17th win and a record-equalling fourth globe.
.
The all-conquering American ski queen added the giant slalom to the super-G and slalom titles having already been crowned the overall champion for the third straight season at the start of March by securing the crystal globe.
.
That drew her alongside Lindsey Vonn and Tina Maze, the only other two women skiers to capture four titles in the one season.
.
Only former Swiss ski great Pirmin Zurbriggen has bettered that tally when he ended the 1987 season with five titles.
.
Shiffrin, who turned 24 this week, has maintained her impressive run of form right to the end, even though she only had to finish in the first 15 on Sunday to be assured of winning the overall giant slalom title.

A single match has four separate teams of eight men wearing waist straps of different colours. They tussle over a 17-kilogram (37-pound) ball made from the wood of a jackfruit tree, laboriously inching it towards one of the holes dug in each team's corner.

.
On first meeting Kierra Scott, it is hard to imagine that the warm and polite 19-year-old makes her living from fighting, provoking and taunting others.
.
Yet that is precisely what makes her a rising star of the women's wrestling scene in Maryland, where Scott plays the role of match villain with great panache.
.
Under the stage name Gia Scott, she launched her career when she was still in high school, and in less than a year has fought a dozen bouts and even taken the title in the MCW, Maryland's local wrestling league, making her the youngest champion in the division's history.
.
Her specialty is playing the ""heel,"" or bad girl who aims to provoke the audience. And when she steps onto the canvas, Kierra becomes Gia, forgetting her friendship with her opponent and sending a thrill of antagonism through the crowd.
.
And off stage, Scott lives a life similar to other young women her age, posting pictures on Instagram, going skating and hanging out with her boyfriend, who is also a wrestler with the stage name of Deion Epps.

When Croatia scored the goal that took them into the World Cup final on Wednesday, an AFP photographer unwittingly became part of the celebrations as he was buried under a pile of joyous players.

After Mario Mandzukic scored in extra-time to give Croatia a 2-1 win against England in the semi-final, he ran to a corner of the pitch at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium to share his joy with his teammates. ""I was just changing my lens as the players ran towards me,"" said photographer Yuri Cortez, who was positioned next to the pitchside advertising boards. ""They just kept coming towards me and they fell on me! It was a crazy moment, they were delighted. Then they suddenly realised that I was underneath them,"" said Mexico City-based Cortez.

Quick as a flash, he picked up his camera and took some remarkable close-up shots of the Croats' joy. ""Then they asked me if I was OK. Another one picked up my lens and another player (Domagoj Vida) gave me a kiss."" Croatia, who have reached the final for the first time in their history, will play France on Sunday.",worldcup fifaworldcup russia2018,"|❤❤👏👏 @dora_alilovic @tina_marinic @marr.ren|😂🔥|Finally a good question : who took THE picture: Mr Cortez or the other photographers around?|@isascoco|Mexican photographers are the best in the world.|@boonanaaaa fotograper nyaa menang banyak.
