Firstly you are not Europe you are the EU there are many countries in Europe that are not in the EU and interestingly none of them want to join! But as you asked...I would like a Europe of democratic self governing  nations that are free to trade and cooperate with their neighbors friends and allies in their mutual interests. I do not want a Europe run by a political class obsessed with federalism and pursuing obsolete ideologies. As regards being the worlds largest economic power that is simply inaccurate and increasingly so as the EUs share of global GDP diminishes year on year. Further once the UK (2nd largest economy and contributor in EU) leaves it will shrink further it is equivalent of the 17 smallest EU economies all leaving at once. Per Pew Reseach only 9% consider the EU the worlds largest economic power. As regards the environment you are trying but 5 out of the worlds top 10 CO2 omitters per capita are EU countries? For start why do you continue to move the entire parliament from Brussels to Strasbourg every few weeks I can only wonder what the environmental impact of this. As regards the EU creating a continent of peace this is such an insult to many especially your allies I suppose the existence of NATO the UK and US being nuclear powers and the US stationing 10000 of troops in Europe had nothing to do with it? Congratulations on the internal peace within European landmass Balkans? Ukraine? Weekly riots in France? Spanish sending civil guard and army into Catalonia (hardly a word from Brussels on this)? As regards ""having a say"" beyond the fact that the EU parliament cannot create law increased cetralisation reduces a person's say and distances the people from decision makers and representatives presumably you are aware that less than 20% of EU's own citizens support greater political integration within the EU?

I’ve spoken with many people who have changed their minds after seeing social division caused by Brexit and learning about the numerous unintended consequences of Brexit. 
During the early stages of the  Brexit vote there were massive misinformation campaigns false promises outright lies and foreign monies pouring into the Brexit campaign. 
It seems that since the British parliament can’t seem to agree on anything regarding to Brexit that certainly letting the British people have the final say to a clear referendum now (with fact checking) that there’s been far more debate discussion and nuanced viewpoints shared about the unintended consequences of Brexit. Also for such a massive decision it seems like the voter approval threshold should be a bit higher. For example if barely over 50% wished to leave you still have close to 50% of your country in complete disagreement which is corrosive to social cohesion. Issues of such importance to me should require perhaps a 60% approval. That’s just my perspective.

86,,,"“I am very proud and happy that in this first half of 2019 I will be managing our common European matters together with you as part of your first ever EU presidency. I am sure that you will be performing your own 'Romanian Rhapsody' with energy and wisdom during these six months. That your presidency will be as energetic as Romanian and as European as the music of George Enescu. And I do not say this just because we are at the Athenaeum tonight. But because I know how resilient and creative the Romanian nation is. I feel that you will do your very best in 'conducting' the orchestra creating the right sound and working as a team with the European interest in mind” said European Council President @donaldtusk at the Thursday’s opening ceremony in Bucharest addresing the audience in Romanian and gaining a standing ovation👏🏼.

“Sunt foarte mândru și fericit că voi conduce împreună cu dumneavoastră afacerile noastre europene comune în acest semestru al primei președinții române a Consiliului Uniunii Europene. Sunt convins că în aceste șase luni veți interpreta cu energie și înțelepciune o adevărată Rapsodie română. Sunt sigur că președinția dumneavoastră va fi la fel de energică de românească și de europeană ca muzica lui George Enescu. Și nu o spun doar pentru că ne aflăm la Ateneu în această seară.  O spun pentru că știu cât de rezistentă și de creativă este națiunea română. Cred că sub bagheta dumneavoastră orchestra va găsi sunetul potrivit și că veți face tot ce vă stă în putință pentru a lucra ca o echipă pentru apărarea intereselor Europei.”

Europe should unite against it. I love Europe but the EC is holding us back|I have been doing sport triathlon marathon extreme sports since 1995. There you have competitors opponents and fights. However you would never reach your goal the top finish the finish line your own goal the pride you have when fighting stubbornly regardless of losses. The focus should be on being together and achieving the better through respect recognition and shared experience. Today it is the one tomorrow the other but one thing remains ... the pride a goal to have made together on a track.
Should we not set aside hostility selfishness intolerance racism violence and domination and remember that we are all human beings with the same goal. With the goal to make our world peaceful healthy and purposeful?
How it can be that runners from all nations can come to a sporting event without the themes of hatred intolerance envy violence ... etc. ?
Because they can! Because they want it and because they consider these topics to be unimportant in their own right!
They want to share a nice experience with each other. Want to exchange and meet everyone with a laugh. Disagreements and wars between nations take a back seat. Everyone helps everyone before the race everyone communicates with each other even with their hands and feet and lo and behold it works. During the race you look into faces and see everywhere luminous eyes dreams visions and respect for the goal the way the common direction and a common goal. The goal to feel the pride to master the way together and to make a shared experience unforgettable for each one.
How nations work together peacefully in marathons triathlons or other events to achieve a common goal should actually work in the world.
You should join hands walk together for miles step by step exchange ideas. and experience each other in order to make progress together.
A nice end to the year 2018 and a peaceful start to the new year 2019

Six months later Bush enlisted into the U.S. Navy[4] immediately after he graduated from Phillips Academy on his eighteenth birthday. He became a naval aviator taking training for aircraft carrier operations aboard USS Sable.[3][5]After completing the 10-month course he was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Naval Reserve at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on June 9 1943 (just three days before his 19th birthday) which made him the youngest naval aviator to that date.[4]
In September 1943 he was assigned to Torpedo Squadron 51 (VT-51) as the photographic officer.[4]The following year his squadron was based in USS San Jacinto as a member of Air Group 51 where his lanky physique earned him the nickname ""Skin"".[6]During this time the task force was victorious in one of the largest air battles of World War II: the Battle of the Philippine Sea.[4]|After Bush's promotion to lieutenant (junior grade) on August 1, 1944, San Jacinto commenced operations against the Japanese in the Bonin Islands. Bush piloted one of four Grumman TBM Avengers of VT-51 that attacked the Japanese installations on Chichijima.[7] His crew for the mission, which occurred on September 2, 1944, included Radioman Second Class John Delaney and Lt.(jg) William White.[4] During their attack, the Avengers encountered intense anti-aircraft fire; Bush's aircraft was hit by flak and his engine caught fire. Despite the fire in his aircraft, Bush completed his attack and released bombs over his target, scoring several damaging hits.[4] With his engine ablaze, Bush flew several miles from the island, where he and one other crew member of the TBM bailed out;[8] the other man's parachute did not open.[4] Bush waited for four hours in an inflated raft, while several fighters circled protectively overhead, until he was rescued by the submarine USS Finback, on lifeguard duty.[4] For the next month, he remained in Finback and participated in the rescue of other aviators. Several of those shot down during the attack were executed, and their livers were eaten by their captors.[9] A radio operator from the Japanese unit that shot down Bush plane was American citizen Nobuaki Iwatake, a Japanese American who had settled in Japan six months before Pearl Harbor and was drafted into the Japanese Imperial Army in 1943.[10] This experience shaped Bush profoundly, leading him to ask, ""Why had I been spared and what did God have for me?""[11]",1445

Their boat capsized. The husband wife and children all drowned. He heard them screaming but did not even know who to save. Now he can't sleep at night. When he closes his eyes he sees his friends and family again crying out for help."" - Maliki Hamidine is director of the assistance & protection centre in Agadez Niger.

Sur la photo ils sourient car l’interprète vient de leur expliquer que c’est la fin de toute cette procédure et que dans quelques jours ils pourront partir vers le pays de relocalisation. Sur la photo on voit le soulagement – des visages plus détendus qu’au moment de notre arrivée. Ils avaient déjà vu beaucoup de gens avant nous. Nous avons pris le temps de leur expliquer la procédure. Pour nous il s’agissait de confirmer l’identité des personnes de vérifier si ces personnes faisaient partie de groups dits vulnérables et notamment s’ils avaient été victimes de la traite d’êtres humains. »

You can see relief on the picture - more relaxed faces than when we first met them. They had already encountered many people before they met us. We took the time to explain the procedure to them.

The Council has in recent years demonstrated its intolerable slowness and inability to handle for Europe crucial issues. This includes everything from the financial crisis to Foreign and Security Policys.

It's time that the Council hand over their power to the elected parliament.
The Council should be replaced by directly elected national representatives and thus become a second chamber to Parliament.
