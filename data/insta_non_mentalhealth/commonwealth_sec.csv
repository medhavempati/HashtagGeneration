12,,,"Study shows encouraging progress in Commonwealth towards gender equality
.
A new Commonwealth paper finds “impressive improvements” in women’s access to maternal health enrolment in primary school and participation in the workforce
.
The technical paper was released at the 12th Women’s Affairs Ministers Meeting in Nairobi Kenya
.
Findings suggest that in the Commonwealth a girl is as likely to attend primary school as a boy is and in some countries more so. In the parliaments of 13 Commonwealth countries 30 per cent or more of members are women
.
Against this progress the paper highlights that persistent gender stereotypes and prejudices in policymaking budgeting and service delivery are disrupting progress
.
For instance only one in five Commonwealth parliamentarians is a woman. Of every 10 girls only seven attend secondary school. Thirty-two countries do not mandate equal pay for work of equal value
.
The Commonwealth undertook the paper to assess and inform ministers on the progress made in 53 member countries in four priority areas: women in leadership women economic empowerment ending violence against women and girls and gender and climate change

The proposal to scale the Commonwealth Climate Finance Access Hub from 10 to 39 developing small states and other vulnerable countries was supported by 70 participants of the Commonwealth Symposium on Climate Finance held in Malta
.
The event was jointly organised by the Commonwealth Secretariat the Government of Malta and the Commonwealth Small States Centre of Excellence
.
It laid the groundwork for the expansion of the hub to the Climate Finance Access Service meaning the Commonwealth will be able to serve non-Commonwealth small states and other vulnerable states
.
Since 2016 the hub has mobilised over USD 25.7 million with a further USD 500 in the pipeline. It has helped 10 Commonwealth small states in the form of 50 mitigation and adaptation projects
.
The hub offers small states and least developed countries expertise to build capacity bridge gaps in technical capabilities and unlock climate finance to access billions of dollars pledged for climate action
.
These projects will help small states reduce emissions and address the effects of climate change on people and ecosystems

.
A groundbreaking study laying down the devastating consequences of climate change and rising seas was published by the Commonwealth Secretariat in September 1989
.
Produced amid a backdrop of disastrous floods in Bangladesh and growing sea inundation in Maldives the report provided world leaders with a glimpse of the dangers they would face in coming decades
.
The ‘Climate Change: Meeting the Challenge’ study led by eminent British scientist Martin Holdgate looked at the projected impact of rising sea levels on vulnerable countries and concluded that the world’s poor would be the “main victims” of climate change
.
Shridath Ramphal then Secretary-General of the Commonwealth who commissioned the report from an international expert group at the Commonwealth Heads of Government summit in Vancouver Canada in 1987 described the threat of climate change in his foreword as “truly global in its implications”
.
The Holdgate report called for a “major international initiative” to establish “global responsibilities” for preventing unmanageable rises in the world’s temperature

The creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat in 1965 and the ever expanding number of professional and advocacy Commonwealth organisations reflect this relevance

But most significant is the expansion of Commonwealth membership from eight countries in 1949 to 53 in 2019 – meaning 33 per cent of people on the planet belong to the Commonwealth and have cause for birthday celebrations!

65,,,"It all began in April 1949 when leaders from Australia Britain Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) India New Zealand Pakistan South Africa and Canada arrived in London for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference
.
Globally it was an era defined by new treaties alliances and a quest for equality.  India was asserting its right to become a republic while at the same time expressing its desire to remain in the Commonwealth
.
This position posed a challenge for the group.  As a republic India could no longer acknowledge King George VI as its head of state. The 1926 Balfour Declaration stated that the countries of the British Commonwealth were united by a common allegiance to the crown
.
In a spirit of comradery and with a promise of new horizons the leaders came to the table to discuss the future of the association.  On 26 April 1949 – 70 years ago today – they gave birth to the modern Commonwealth by signing the London Declaration
.
The declaration was a turning point for the group and set the Commonwealth on a new path.  It dropped the “British” prefix from the organisation’s name and emphasised the freedom and equality of its members - not just in their relationship to the King as Head of the Commonwealth but also in their co-operative ‘pursuit of peace liberty and progress’
.
Notably it declared that the crown was to be regarded ‘the symbol’ of the Commonwealth association allowing India to remove the King as its head of state but recognise him as Head of the Commonwealth
.

89,,,"Happy #CommonwealthDay from the Commonwealth Small States Office (#CSSO) in New York!
.
Commonwealth sets up a 'Small States Office' in New York so that small states can take part in UN negotiations.
.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s when several of the small states in the Pacific and Asia became independent one of their objectives was to join the UN. Commonwealth countries in those regions suggested a single office for representatives from these small states. This was seen as an alternative to those countries setting up new Missions - representations to intergovernmental agencies - in New York. Australia provided the initial funding for the Commonwealth Secretariat to establish the New York office.
.
The benefits of this facility to smaller states like Samoa and the Solomon Islands soon attracted other small states member countries. In 1985 at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Nassau The Bahamas Heads of Government requested that the Commonwealth Secretary-General explore the possibility of extending the facility to other Commonwealth small states.

92,,,"Celebrations and events will be held across the world on 11 March to mark #CommonwealthDay.

The day will feature everything from street parties to church services from democracy debates to fashion shows as 2.4 billion people in 53 Commonwealth countries celebrate the history and values that bind them together.
.
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the modern Commonwealth. In the 1949 London Declaration leaders agreed that Commonwealth countries are “free and equal members of the Commonwealth of Nations freely co-operating in the pursuit of peace liberty and progress”.
.
This year’s event is centred around the theme of ‘A #ConnectedCommonwealth’ highlighting how friendship goodwill and collaboration among the Commonwealth’s culturally diverse members can be harnessed to tackle some of the planet’s biggest challenges - such as protecting natural resources and the environment.

The Queen as Head of the Commonwealth will join Secretary-General Patricia Scotland at @westminsterabbeylondon for a multi-faith service to celebrate the day. It will include performances by @cleanbandit and @mralfieboe. Endurance swimmer and ocean advocate @lewis.pugh will also speak at the London event
.
Commonwealth Day has been celebrated across the Commonwealth every year since the 1970s. In recent years there has been a shift away from celebrating a single day towards celebrating a full week with Commonwealth Day at its focus and first day. The aim is to celebrate the unity diversity and links of the modern Commonwealth and to foster greater understanding of the Commonwealth’s achievements and role.
.
On Wednesday 13 March the annual Commonwealth Youth Awards (#CYA) for Excellence in Development Work will be awarded to young people from each of the Commonwealth’s regions

93,,,"Read the #CommonwealthDay Message by Her Majesty The Queen Head of the #Commonwealth:
.
“Commonwealth Day has a special significance this year as we mark the 70th anniversary of the London Declaration when nations of the Commonwealth agreed to move forward together as free and equal members. The vision and sense of connection that inspired the signatories has stood the test of time and the Commonwealth continues to grow adapting to address contemporary needs.
.
Today many millions of people around the world are drawn together because of the collective values shared by the Commonwealth. In April last year I welcomed the leaders of our 53 nations to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and we all witnessed how the Commonwealth vision offers hope and inspires us to find ways of protecting our planet and our people.
.
We are able to look to the future with greater confidence and optimism as a result of the links that we share and thanks to the networks of cooperation and mutual support to which we contribute and on which we draw. With enduring commitment through times of great change successive generations have demonstrated that whilst the goodwill for which the Commonwealth is renowned may be intangible its impact is very real.
.
We experience this as people of all backgrounds continue to find new ways of expressing through action the value of belonging in a connected Commonwealth. I hope and trust that many more will commit to doing so this Commonwealth Day.”

The title is bestowed annually to a person or organisation in recognition of significant contributions to women’s economic empowerment. Previous recipients include the @worldbank .

The award recognises the Secretary-General’s commitment to making gender mainstreaming a core element of the Commonwealth’s programme work and urging bold action to close the persistent economic gender gap between men and women around the world.
.
The citation further notes her dedication to making women’s economic empowerment an urgent priority for Commonwealth member countries through initiatives such as a tool to estimate the economic cost of violence against women and girls. This programme examines how the direct cost of violence such as loss of income can lead to a much larger impact on the economy

In the Blue Charter’s own words the time has come to “move from words to actions.” Already eight Action Groups are being established led by Commonwealth countries with the goal to cross-promote shared technical scientific and policy solutions to effect broader implementation and change. Further action groups are likely to focus on topics such as maritime security offshore emergency response and aquaculture.

129,,,"Secretary-General Patricia Scotland will pay her first official visit to the island nation of Seychelles this week signalling the Commonwealth’s continued interest in being a voice for small states.

Key issues such as trade innovation the blue economy women youth and climate change will be top of the agenda. “With small states constituting over 60 per cent of our membership the Commonwealth has always been a strong advocate for the causes of small states including Seychelles and has consistently raised international awareness of their inherent vulnerabilities” said the Secretary-General who will also be the guest of honour at celebrations of the 42nd anniversary of Seychelles’ independence. “Indeed as a champion of small states we have long been at the forefront of policy research and global advocacy to build resilience and support sustainable development and economic growth” she stated.

During the visit Secretary-General Scotland will launch a pioneering report on the economic cost of violence against women and girls in Seychelles. Using an innovative economy-wide model the report reveals the real costs of violence to the Seychelles economy (more than US$65 million annually) while supporting effective policies to address gender equality.

The visit will also include a handover ceremony reaffirming Commonwealth support to Seychelles in building the local blue economy. The Blue Economy Strategic Roadmap to be launched later in the year was developed with Commonwealth technical assistance and charts directions for future investment and transition to a vibrant and sustainable ocean-based economy.

Following her visit to Seychelles the Secretary-General will travel to Mauritius on 1 July. ————————————————————————

Zimbabwe joined the Commonwealth on its independence in 1980 and withdrew from the organisation in 2003. To re-join Zimbabwe must demonstrate that it complies with the fundamental values set out in the Commonwealth Charter including democracy and rule of law plus protection of human rights such as freedom of expression. The membership process requires an informal assessment to be undertaken by representatives of the Secretary-General followed by consultations with other Commonwealth countries. Zimbabwe has also invited the Commonwealth to observe its forthcoming elections in July.

A Humble Joy by Bradley Walker

In an age where youth and beauty is celebrated seniors in the Commonwealth are often overlooked and locked out of so many things. Let's not forget them –  the seniors who fought for freedom fought for rights that we enjoy and bestowed on the following generations a  wisdom through a lifetime of experience. While this woman may be in her sunset years – her world a bit smaller shared with a furry friend – her indomitable spirit shines though. An Inclusive Commonwealth includes them.",cwphotocomp16,|My dad did that,8

Pluralism: A heartbeat of Inclusiveness by Raheel Taj	Uddin (@raheellakhani)

My parents’ room had a night bulb in the shape of a flower and each petal had a different color of light. I couldn’t take it out of socket so I tried to move my camera to paint with light. It took nearly 30 shots to get the image of ‘heart’. I believe that the real power of the commonwealth is in the mindset of pluralism which creates understanding among nations to use our colors and diversity to empower each other.

Belly Blessing by Rayhaan Joseph (@studio19tt)

A local artist performing her very first henna belly blessing on a woman who having surpassed great obstacles is having her first child.  This photo was captured during a collaboration as a means of celebration both in our diverse culture and in the birth of a new life to this world who to our surprise was delivered the very next day.

Cultural Fusion by Keno George (@kenog_photography)

Holi is a festival that encourages its celebrants regardless of cultural norms race class gender or ethnicity to take notice of the beauty in life and the culture that lies within our world.

XV South Pacific Games Opening Ceremony by Alistairs Dirua

The South Pacific Games is held every four years. This year it was held in Port Moresby Papua New Guinea and for the first time in the Game's history we had Australia and New Zealand participating. Prince Andrew Duke of York was there to give the opening speech.
I was fortunate enough to be present at the opening ceremony and captured this photo. It is a glimpse of the breath-taking fireworks display that kept about 20000 people from 24 different Pacific countries mesmerized for an hour.",cwphotocomp16,|That is some fine Photography.

This photo depicts a young boy who was given the opportunity to join the cultural festivities of a typical Sugar Mas Experience Troupe dubbed the Masqueraders. The masqueraders are engulfed in bright colours as they paint the streets.

Unseen Places by Adedotun Ajibade (@adedotunajibade)

Behind the thin smoke screen from a local kiln is a slum. This is Makoko; a settlement on the lagoon built on stilts home to over 150000 people with tall dreams and low living standards. The beauty of Lagos told in swanky skyscrapers and high life lies at the other end of the lagoon. Realities are close yet the disparity is wide.

Return To the Door of No Return by Matilda Dogbatsey (@kafuipraise)

I took this picture at Cape Coast Castle Central Region Ghana on the 1st of July 2015.

I wanted others who have never visited  The Cape Coast Castle"" to feel this. Yes we can acknowledge the pain and the scars that remain but I hope the beauty we see in this photo can heal all of us on many levels.

This photo to me explains how Kenyans have come out as people and members of the Commonwealth to make each day count in the growth of this large society. This is on chicken farm (IQ farm) owned by a Kenyan who supplies  eggs to three different counties.

Althought they highly lead to houses getting on fire cases it is still the only option to use and that was my sister trying to move with the light on her way to serve us food.",cwphotocomp16,|@ebru.klls...Please like this photo and share|@saracgzm like the pic|@dmb_bizwa Just like this picture|@ckabengel  @king_raygel yaya bo aimer kaka eza concours,51

Through the lens of my camera I became close friends with the female Jamican Anole on April 23 2015 at University of Technology by Talicia Wilson ( @talicia.photography ) 
The photograph depicts a Jamaican female Anole which is a species of Anolis lizard originally endemic to Jamaica although it has since been introduced to Bermuda. It is one of seven Anole species found on Jamaica. The lizard has pigments under it's skin that allow it to change color. I use this to explain that though we are of different skin color or racial background at the end of the day we are all one. ""An inclusive commonwealth"" describes the photograph completely through the interaction.",cwphotocomp16,|@king_sevii @jhenzi @delljelz @hey_vee @marisa.z @shen_nae @kymberleys_photography_ @shennice_harris @super_j7|Guuuys like this nuh plz @the_shannique @marilyn_tj @artisticsoulsss @maurice.lungrin @amantha_sagitaurus|@gtoniann_ @abi_cocaine @anirbw|like and tag others|@princess__davia|@bririxx  @debbii_debz @melo_melz @sassydivatash @mz_conceited_93 @mona_lisa479|Beautiful 👌 @marisa.z|@empress_sonica @charlavoyy @djhac.don @kadii_fabulous876 @__efuru__ @joneilia.th @jessie_loyal like please|@cam_eika @darksapphire @xxiv_i_ @_ahseya_blackonblack_march25 @swag_don_tevez @_askel_17 like this please|@__yxnique|@christybydesign|@doing_me369 @laurbpcamp|@empress_shammy @shanziibae @nigguh__rich @danny_top_g @d_kcomplex @frazz_af @yonnie_gudgurl @gioo_don @d_twenty20 @jevjournalist|@_adehsur_ @aicened @xqxeen|@forevermo._ @sosaababy199x @akeemvsk @brittany_senior @__trishvn.sg like plz|@1brittnyy @chin.glock40 @itzz_leian @shanice__good like plz|@david_maddem @djhac.don @_dmitrius @lennekawalker_ @__shanaay @your_valentine_|@foodie_g @kiseanpalmer @hand.tie.social|Like this please guys. @_taniquerankine @kimmzii_whimmzii @kimme_kim_kim @_manii.k @richie_rich_richard_ @t_niz|@sweetz_pb @zavilopez|@_gabri.ella|Niiiiiiice @tally_supreme!!

Helping Hand by Jeffrey Okundi ( @djguka )

In an era where we have been brought up knowing that there is a huge divide between the rich and the poor the generation of today tends to look down upon the social class that is below the social class in which they belong. My picture shows that it takes one to show that we are equal regardless of status.

Building Synergies and Partnerships for Sustainable Development by @narimanbisma

The photo shows two kids pushing a cycle and one riding it helping the kid in the back seat reach his destination. The kid in the back seat is watching others passing by without offering help but the three kids in collaboration are putting their energies to help their fellow to move forward. This shows an excellent example of an inclusive commonwealth where there is resource sharing team work trust and equality among Commonwealth countries.",cwphotocomp16,"|@bacco123456789 @anniequreshi99 @ayaal298  @aminnaila @revathi_batola @perimsubayrak @pamosa7 @bornaxo @cla6928 @luisa19.fernanda please like this  its for a noble cause|@narimanbisma this is nice photo showing supportive attitude for others and moving together with trust.|@maryamkhan0904 @faizan.bukhari_ @muhammadt0qeer @qroonjha @haroonworld like the one with the lizard plzzzzzz im from jamaica|@sumayahasan @hoflolz|Itna log tag kiya and they say ""you can't tag more than 10 people"" huh!|@benishgulzar @mikeyjb666 @saramuzblogs @pdpbasyal @sohail_bombaywala @meena.barakzai @bushhee @hambaig.07 @ochamaaa @beekay101  People please like this picture and help my friend to get more likes by forwarding it to others.|@fatimasaeedpsw u can tag frnds in multiple comments  aik comment mein 10 tag ho sktay hyn|@narimanbisma Haan got it.
