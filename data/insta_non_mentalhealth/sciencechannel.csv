This layer is semi-permeable and the concentrated salt solution inside the tube pushes outwards due to osmosis. This bursts the tube releasing more salt solution and forming a new tube and the process continues.

22,,,"Beaten and bruised from the week? So are these members of Boletaceae family — these #mushrooms turn blue when cut or bruised. This bluing reaction is not due to the presence of psychoactive alkaloids (as is the case for Psilocybe). These boletes turn blue due to the oxidation of variegatic acidm which is red in it's reduced form. When the fungal cells are damaged variegatic acid is enzymatically oxidized to its quinone methide form which is blue.

23,,,"The Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II is a single-engine stealth combat aircraft capable of short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL). 🛩 Unlike other variants the F-35B has no landing hook and must land vertically. To do this jet thrust is sent directly downwards during vertical flight. The variant's three-bearing swivel nozzle that directs the full thrust of the engine is moved by a ""fueldraulic"" actuator using pressurized fuel as the working fluid.

38,,,"Climbing out of the primordial ooze is Charles the Mudskipper — the fish that can survive both in and out of water. Charles is feeling rather dapper this time of year; it's mating season and with the season comes the bright blue spots across his body. Charles has the ability to breathe through his skin and as long as he stays wet he is able to remain on land.💦 However at the end of his day he will head home to his intertidal habitat with or without a mate. #ThatsTheWayLoveGoes

43,,,"This bleeding beauty is the Corrugated Milk Cap or Lactifluus Corrugis. It grows in mycorrhizal association with oaks in eastern North America and has a white spore print. Here we showcase the defining trait of Lactifluus/Lactarius mushrooms the ""latex"" which bleeds when injured. The latex is stored in specialized cells called ""lactiferous tubes"" that release latex into the mouths unsuspecting bugs and slugs suffocating them or at least messing up their day. 🐌 When thoroughly cooked this mushroom makes a phenomenal edible especially when roasted or pickled. 🎥+ caption by Gordon Walker (@FascinatedbyFungi)

While there are over 8000 different species of the superfamily Acridoidea the Egyptian Locust is easily identifiable due to its striped compound eyes. This brightly colored nymph (juvenile) is feasting in anticipation of its next molt.🌿 These grasshoppers undergo several molts gradually developing wings and growing in size with each exuviate.

An amoeba moves by changing its shape and forming projections called pseudopodia ⁠— bulges of cytoplasm formed by the coordinated action microfilaments pushing out the plasma membrane that surrounds the cell. 🔬 by Martin Kaae Kristiansen (@my.microscopic.world)

52,,,"Take a good look.👀 You are staring into the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom and the most complex visual system ever discovered.🦐 The eyes of a mantis shrimp are mounted on mobile stalks and can move independently of each other. Each eye has between 12-16 types of photoreceptor cells ⁠— humans have just 3. Referred to as 'spectral tuning' the shrimp is able to tune the sensitivity of their long-wavelength color vision to adapt to their environment; allowing it to perceive wavelengths of light ranging from deep ultraviolet (UVB) to far-red (300 to 720 nm) and polarized light. In addition to their legendary eyes a mantis shrimp can punch with a speed equal to a bullet. This enables them to break open mollusks and dismember other crustaceans. You don't need a watch dog you need a Mantis Shrimp.

53,,,"This silkworm (Bombyx mori 蚕) is entering the pupal phase of its lifecycle. 🐛 This 'final molt' from larva to pupa takes place within the cocoon as it encloses itself in 1000 to 3000 feet of raw silk produced by the salivary glands. If the animal is allowed to survive through the pupal phase of its lifecycle it will release proteolytic enzymes to make a hole in the cocoon and emerge as an adult moth.🦋 However these enzymes are destructive to the silk and can cause the silk fibers to break down reducing the value of the silk threads. To prevent this silkworm cocoons are boiled ⁠— the heat kills the silkworms and the water makes the cocoons easier to unravel. Often the #silkworm itself is eaten.

57,,,"This cricket didn't stand a chance.💀 It has been overrun by a Cordyceps #fungus a species of endoparasitoid ⁠that thrives at the expense of the host. When a cordyceps attacks the mycelium invades and eventually replaces the host tissue. What happened here is the fungi began living inside the cricket allowing it to grow until the parasitoid emerged as an adult. It began to control the crickets behavior — causing it to climb a plant and attach there. This ensured the parasitoid's environment would be at the optimal temperature and humidity for maximal distribution of the spores. Finally the cordyceps paralyzed the cricket and began living outside of it. RIP 🦗

58,,,"🛩Aerial refueling or ""tanking"" is the process of transferring aviation fuel from one aircraft (the tanker) to another (the receiver) during flight.⛽️ This allows the receiver to takeoff with a greater payload as the maximum takeoff weight is maintained by carrying less fuel and topping off once airborne. This activity is only used during #military operations.

60,,,"LOOK OUT! There’s a Sunflower Sea Star coming through. 🌻This 22-armed sea-floor dwelling predator is on the hunt. Utilizing 15000 tube feet on its underside the star moves at a speed of 3.3 ft/min. This NE Pacific native mostly feeds on small invertebrates and sea urchins but it can greatly extend its mouth for larger prey and can even extend its stomach outside of its mouth to digest a catch. Should the sea star feel threatened it will shed its arms to escape only to grow them back within a few weeks. Talk about getting so scared that you #JumpOutOfYourSkin.

61,,,"The little guy taking a spin is a #Rotifer and it's riding on some multicellular algae called volvox. 🦠 Each sphere of this green freshwater algae ⁠can contain thousands of individual cells ⁠— The outer layer is made of somatic cells capable of moving the entire colony towards the light by use of sensitive “eye-spots.” Inside the volvox you'll notice structures known as daughter colonies. Eventually the volvox will break and the daughters will have to become parents. #ItsaSmallWorldAfterAll .

63,,,"🌿This #WeekendGetaway we're taking you to the Norwegian coast where #kelp forests cover over 5800 km. Here you will find more than 100000 mobile invertebrates per square meter on kelp stipes and holdfasts. Dense well-developed kelp forests are essential to the ecosystem but they are threatened by overfishing causing an increase in herbivore populations leading to over-grazing. This can quickly result in barren landscapes where only a small number of species can thrive.🐡 Other major factors that threaten the kelp forests include marine pollution water quality climate change and certain invasive species. So let's all work together to #ProtectTheSeaweed!

I thought my life had nothing to offer anymore because life became meaningless to me because I had HERPES virus, the symptoms
became very severe and bold and made my family run from and abandoned me so they won't get infected. I gave up everything, my hope, dreams,vision and job because the doctor told me there's no cure. I consumed so many drugs but they never cured me but hid the symptoms inside me making it worse. I was doing some research online someday when I came across testimonies of some people of how Dr.Akhimien cured them from HERPES, I never believed at first and thought it was a joke but later decided to contact him on the details provided and when I messaged him we talked and he sent me his herbal medicine and told me to go for a test after two weeks. Within 9 days of medication the symptoms disappeared and when I won't be unhappy for a test Lo and behold I was NEGATIVE by the Doctor Who tested me earlier.

66,,,"This is a #slug. We named her Abby.🐌🍃 Abby is a shell-less terrestrial gastropod #mollusk who is mostly made of water. She tends to get excited and active just after a rain storm due to the moist ground. In drier conditions she hides in damp places like tree bark to ensure she stays wet. Staying wet is essential for Abby as she must generate protective mucus to survive. This mucus leaves behind a ""slime trail"" which other slugs are able to recognize and follow in search of a mate. #OnTheRoadToLove

68,,,"Yikes! That's a #bloodworm.🐛 A carnivorous member of the Annelida phylum -- they feed by extending a large proboscis bearing four hollow jaws and utilize venom to kill their prey. Reproduction occurs in midsummer as the warmer water and the lunar cycle triggers sexually mature worms to transform into a non-feeding stage called the epitoke. The worms swim to the surface of the water where both sexes release gametes and then die. FIN.

71,,,"🍑 This weeks #FungusFriday feature is Mycelium -- the vegetative part of a fungus consisting of a branching thread-like hyphae. Through the mycelium a fungus absorbs nutrients from its environment. The hyphae secrete enzymes into the food source breaking down biological polymers into smaller units such as monomers. These monomers are then absorbed into the mycelium by facilitated diffusion and active transport. Mycelia are vital to the ecosystem contributing to the organic fraction of soil and releasing CO2 back into the atmosphere. So your rotting peach is actually pretty important.

Like we humans are exploring the universe in search of life they might be doing the same if they are intelligent beings. But to me alien spaceship with such an incredible speed sounds stupid because it contradicts the rules of physics. To travel into far space we will need a super fast and ultralight spaceship which is practically totally impossible as of now. As Einstein's theory says anything having some mass if travels at a speed of light or near it will have an increase in mass gradually and if it reaches the speed of light then the mass will be so much that it will crush itself. Also we would need an infinite source of energy to travel at that speed. But I hope in near future traveling into far space will become easy because we humans are capable of making things possible which we dream of. 😉✌|😳|All I truly see is my Asp Explorer from Elite: Dangerous. *heavy breathing* DAYDREAMING INTENSIFIES|Wait is this the History Channel?|@isabellaxivanova|Best part is that it fits perfectly to what bob Lazar claimed.

77,,,"Two male cuttlefish challenge one another for dominance and the opportunity to mate with a female. The cephalopods squirt large amounts of black ink in an effort to disorient and confuse their opponent. But for the smaller male fighting is not an option. Smaller cuttlefish use their camouflage abilities to disguise themselves as a female changing their body color and pretending to hold an egg sack as they slide right past the fighting males.

81,,,"Horseshoe #crabs 🦀 have been around for more than 450 million years. They're straight up older than dinosaurs but that's not the most interesting part. Their copper laced blue blood is one of the most expensive resources on 🌎 and is a vital tool in #medtech that is utilized in FDA testing. 🧪 The blood reacts to the presence of bacterial endotoxins -- allowing scientists to check vaccines or medical tools for contaminants. During the extraction 30% of the crabs blood is drained. After the crabs are returned to the water where blood levels will return back to normal. So be sure to thank your neighborhood horseshoe crab for their blue blood contributions.

Actually the lab has to rehabilitate them (for 1-2weeks) before they put them back into the wild - as they are very vulnerable after their blood had been extracted. Also not all of them survive back into the wild when their blood has been extracted. Lastly we do not know if all labs rehabilitate them back into the wild after extraction or just dump them back into the wild.|👏 hermosa criatura..ojala no desaparezca..gracias al hombre !!|@janisetemiller|@ittybittybabsigail I like fun facts|When my family and I visit Cape May we have a tradition of getting up in the morning to go see the horseshoe crabs.

84,,,"Follow the Siq and find yourself in the ancient city of #Petra. Look up and gaze upon the magnificent Al-Khazneh. 🏜 The mausoleum earned its name ""The Treasury"" from a fabled legend that bandits or pirates hid their loot in a stone urn high on the second level. Significant damage from bullets can be seen today and local lore claims that the Bedouins shot at the urn in the early 20th century. They hoped to find fortune but instead they found only solid sandstone. #WeekendGetaway

85,,,"Welcome back to the Fungi Kingdom. For this #fungusfriday we present to you: 🍄 Lentinula edodes better known as the Shiitake #mushroom! Native to SE Asia and a member of the Basidiomycota phylum shiitake is capable of synthesizing lignin peroxidase; meaning they are able to digest wood. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that shiitake are most commonly found on the decaying wood of deciduous trees. #science .

87,,,"This is a dragonfly we named him Henry. Henry is a semi-aquatic member of the carnivorous insect order -- Odonata. His distinct compound eyes are composed of thousands of tiny independent photoreception units that include a cornea lens and photoreceptor cells. This allows Henry to see a wide angle and detect fast movement but his image resolution is poor. 👎 So don't feel bad that your garden dragonfly doesn't recognize you. #science 🐛

89,,,"Happy #microscopicmonday! This 6 tentacled organism is the Hydra Vulgaris or better known as the fresh-water polyp. The Hydra does not undergo senescence; ergo it is a biologically immortal member of the animilia kingdom. Reproduction can go 3 different ways: sexual reproduction budding and indirectly through regeneration. Drawing a similitude with the Starfish; a Hydra can be cut into segments that will grow into an individual fresh-water polyp. Adults grow to a length of 10mm to 30mm with a width of about 1 mm.

92,,,"Happy #FungusFriday! Unlike plants molds don't grow from seeds they grow from tiny spores that float around in the air. Mold thrives on high-acid foods as well as soft fruits and vegetables with high moisture content. And it doesn’t stop there; they can contaminate food below the surface.

The South Korean water bug (Muljarus japonicus) lays 30 to 40 eggs every summer and the males carry the eggs on their backs for two weeks until they hatch. However these baby bugs will need to be on high alert once they enter the world as adult water bugs often feed off their own larvae. Talk about a parent trap! 😳🤢

104,,,"Cicadas best known for their loud buzzing sound can live 4-17 years but most of that lifespan is spent underground as larvae. Their relatively short adulthood lasts for only about 2-6 weeks above ground. Once emerged cicadas will climb the nearest tree to shed their old skin revealing a brand-new body and a fresh set of wings.  Did you know that some cicada calls can be heard up to 1 mile away?

The higurashi is a type of cicada. The name as Shinji Ogawa points out means ""evening cicada."" One dictionary calls it a ""clear toned cicada."" Shinji explains ""An evening cicada sings in rich modulation in a sing-song way."" While ordinary cicadas are associated with summer higurashi is an autumn season word in haiku ""based on the elegant tones."" R. H. Blyth sees the light in this haiku to be the ""last rays of the sunken sun"" glittering on the water; A History of Haiku (Tokyo: Hokuseido 1964) 1.361. Kai Falkman appreciates the haiku's structure: ""The sound [of the cicada] opens up a whole landscape like a fan spreading out before our eyes""; see Understanding Haiku: A Pyramid of Meaning (Winchester VA: Red Moon Press 2002) 73.|@llaned @ktigre13|OMG...what a Wonderful Transformer|@althea.roa|What the hell do they do underground for 17 years?|3rd impact|@anamariapins|Woah 😳|Awesome power of nature|♥♥♥♥♥|@zeyad.elazab|Is this 'Ecdysis'?|Y a si es como cell apareció en el futuro 👏😍💪😂|@fmbyvanessagonzalez morr la cicada !!|@mcchagrin  wow/ew damn|Me after completing PhD|@yeahyeziwoo|Nope don’t like that|Finally I've seen it|😯🙄|I ❤️ cicadas 💜|oh it is cell.. its 2nd form.. now he will find the androids for its final form 😂😂😂😂|❤❤|SubhanAllah|What is the purpose or reason for cicadas?|🎆|They are actually good singers|❤️|@voneugenio YAYAY!|@amelia25campo|@lizaa.f mao mati gua liatnya|Amazing insects I don't know if such kind of species might be available in East Africa especially Tanzania|@alexiszany => pour Agathe!!|👍👍|@danfelcon|@syhdhnz._  @_ana.qilla|Some like to dip them in batter & fry em' up!😋😋|Wow it's beautiful|@alineolivea|@timpaniniko  This is how a Slice of Life Anime begins|Wow!|What a unique beauty !|👍👍|😲|Hey awesome post!

107,,,"Happy World UFO Day! In 1947 Pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine flying objects near Mt. Rainier in Washington. Arnold timed the sighting and calculated the objects' speed to be over 1200 mph. He described the aircraft as saucer-like leading to news headlines referring to them as flying saucers! Six years later the United States Air Force coined the term Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO).

109,,,"The best time to spot a rainbow is just after a rainstorm. Rainbows are found when white light from the Sun passes through raindrops. This causes white light to refract into seven different colors following their wavelengths. There is always a second rainbow just above the first but they are usually faint. Note that the colors of the twin rainbow are inverted from the original - this is because the light rays have undergone a second refraction! This rainbow was captured in Crater Lake in Oregon.🌈

110,,,"Any Summer travel plans? Consider going to the Netherlands! These lovely tulips from Lisse were raised in well-drained moist soil an ideal condition for tulip-growing. With 150 species and over 3000 varieties tulips require a period of vernalization a period of cold dormancy. Over seven million tulips bloom from mid-April to early May but in July you can still visit the Tulip Park in Vondelpark Amsterdam for a tulip-picking experience. Aren’t they colorful?

111,,,"Happy #FungusFriday! This flush of pink oyster mushrooms (pleurotus djamor) is a sight to behold. They are fast colonizers that grow in large bouquets. Pink oysters are vibrantly pink especially on their underside but they whiten as they age. These mushrooms are juicy and meaty but their short shelf life make it difficult for them to appear in local grocery stores. 🍄

112,,,"Ever wonder how hot air balloons float? Hot air balloons work because hot air rises - it's lighter than the cooler air outside - causing the balloon to float upwards! The balloons’ burners mix liquid propane with oxygen and ignites it heating the air inside the balloon. These hot air balloons are from the annual balloon festival in Chiang Rai Thailand. Aren't they colorful!?

113,,,"Feeling scrambled in the middle today? We understand. Did you know that blenders were invented by Stephen Poplawski in 1922. To mix up drinks like malts and milk shakes Poplawski had the idea of placing an automatic spinning blade at the bottom of a container. This would not have been possible without the 1910 invention of small electric motors. In the 1950s blenders were used in hospitals and labs and were a vital research tool during the development of the polio vaccine!

Common in urban and suburban America these caterpillars are extremely docile - they'll barely move to reach the next bite of food. When they run out of food they slowly walk away to find a new leaf.

Niagara Falls was formed over 12000 years ago at the end of the ice age when large cascades of water drained into the Niagara River thus carving a path through the Niagara Escarpment. Although holding the record for being the world’s most visited waterfall it’s actually not the tallest or largest. Angel Falls is the world’s tallest waterfall at a height of 3212 ft while Victoria Falls is classified as the largest with a width of 5604 ft.

116,,,"Meet #SpongeBob's real-life best friend Patrick! Starfish though marine creatures are not true fish - they do not have gills scales or fins like fish do. They can’t propel themselves with their arms but they use their tiny tube feet to move along the sea bed. Though starfish have no blood they use filtered sea water to pump nutrients through their nervous systems. They are strong hunters and eat by extending their stomach and mouth over the soft body parts of their prey!

118,,,"Happy #TechThursday! Here’s some aviation facts to cruise you through the end of the week! The 747 family has flown more than 5.6 billion people. That's equal to approx 80% of the world’s population. Did you know pilots and co-pilots are required to eat different meals? Also traveling by air can cause you to shed water so stay hydrated! Finally about 1/3 of your taste buds are numbed while flying so maybe that in-flight pasta was better than you thought!

119,,,"Wishing you could hide away? Here’s a fish that hides away in life. The Flounder is a master of camouflage. Like chameleons flounders change the colors and patterns of their exposed skin to match their surroundings. When the time is right they strike quickly consuming their pray. Did you know flounders are actually born with an eye on each side of their heads? As they age one eyes moves until both eyes are on the same side of the head.

120,,,"Still trying to construct your week? Here are a few facts about some people who've nailed it - literally. A construction company in #China is believed to have constructed the world’s fastest building. Known as “Mini Sky City” it is a 57 story tower built in only 19 days. The Burj Khalifa building in #Dubai is the biggest building to be built in modern times. It took about 12000 people per day to finish the project- the equivalent of a small city. Finally the 3250000 cubic yards of concrete used to build the Hoover Dam is enough to build a 3000 mile two-lane highway from New York to California!

121,,,"Time to burst your weekend bubble. Here’s some hydrogen to get you started. It has the greatest heat conductivity of all the elements; meaning kinetic energy flows through it faster than any other gas. It's highly flammable and often used as fuel for spacecraft but it's also being developed for use in automobiles. It has the potential to revolutionize transportation by dramatically reducing harmful emissions.

122,,,"What’s better than fishing on #FathersDay? The Stilt Fishing method unique to #SriLanka is actually more modern than you’d think. Believed to have started post World War II when food shortages and overcrowded fishing prompted some men to fish directly on water. The tradition was then passed between at least two generations of fishermen. Sadly this method has become increasingly obsolete after the 2004 tsunami altered Sri Lankan shores and reduced access to fish.

123,,,"Waves don’t die! Ocean tides are one of the most reliable phenomena in the world. Traveling around the world at 450 miles per hour tides have no beginning and no end. The 12-hour gradual rise and fall we see on the beach is the wave’s passing first its crest and then its trough. Did you know: The astronomical forces causing the tide (the moon and sun) don’t just affect the ocean. Their gravitational forces produce tidal movement everywhere including the solid earth the atmosphere and even in your morning cup of coffee!

126,,,"Struggling to get over #humpday? Well at least you're not this fly. The Venus fly trap lures its prey with nectar and when the moment is right its jaws close. Contrary to popular belief flying insects make up less than 5% of the plant's diet. Here's a fun fact: studies have shown these carnivorous plants can even digest small bits of human flesh so maybe ""Little Shop of Horrors"" was on to something.

The sample will be able to tell us what minerals are present in the bedrock and if there used to be water present in that area.

183,,,"Scientists in China have created a monkey that may be a little bit more like us. Researches inserted copies of the MCPH1 gene which is believed to play a role in brain development and introduced it into monkey embryos through a virus that carried the gene. Six of the 11 monkeys they created died but the ones who survived did not have bigger brains. They did however perform better on short-term memory tasks. The monkey’s brains also developed over a longer period of time much like human brains. Now onto the question of ethics…

187,,,"This is the first ever image of a black hole taken by the Event Horizon Telescope. The super massive black hole pictured is at the center of Messier 87 a massive galaxy in the constellation of Virgo. It’s located 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times larger than our sun. This is a huge achievement not only because its confirms Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity but because it opens up the possibility for visual observations of a black hole’s immediate environment.

Where are the distant stars? Distant galaxies. Why is it Not defined...? Is it bad quality? 
Why are they deformalities and so much asymmetry?? Shouldn’t a black hole absorb everything to its center quasi-equally.  So Why does it have asymmetry around it. The light around it should be almost perfectly round and there shouldn’t be any bulks of dissipated light in some regions and not in the others?... this implies that a black hole is not  equal in power in all directions which is very highly strange ....|So basically we are seeing a Black hole that might have existed 55 million years ago🤔|@kevstaph89|Why is it red|Amazing grt work|@me_talhashaikh|😮😮|@melisdee|You're such a 🤡|Looking like a doughnut 🍩|OMG ⚫️🙀|Biggest photo of the year and dude couldn't even stay in focus smh|😮😮😮|@jyoungpan|They zoomed in unfocused on a person smoking a cigarette and people believe it 🤣🤣🤣|As of Einstein's theory needed confirmation.

A study released Thursday says scientists discovered one of the first small planet fragments in orbit around a dead white dwarf star. The finding “sheds light into the twilight years of planetary systems” according to the study.

Thats it.. poor Admin|While it is easy to quote statements and blame countries as an Indian I would say that India played a part in increasing orbital debris around our planet. In the midst of all this we are missing the point here. These missions have been in play for a really long time and it might be relief that most of them burn to ashes. But shouldn't we be aiming to curb the problem altogether? As if planet Earth was not enough we just have to pollute the space as well! If we look at records we as the cohabitants of this planet have significantly reduced our addition into the debris but we have done nothing to reduce it and that is the only problem here which no one will address because covering disagreements would mean more publicity means more money.|Just what the world needs.... more drunk neighbors....|😂 that’s insane and impossible india shot down satellite which was in lower orbit and its debris was supposed to fall back into earth’s orbit within 24 hrs. Btw there is trillion of other space debris many of which falls back every single day. Un-noticed. You can’t blame india for it’s achievements. 😆 So many Indians are working in NASA.

Now it’s thickening and flowing more slowly according to researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The growth is caused by a climate pattern in which the northern Atlantic Ocean to flip between cooler and warmer waters every five to 20 years. Yet researchers said this is a “temporary break” for the glacier and that it will likely recede once more when the climate pattern warms waters again according to @USAToday.

Scientists @uniofnottingham say Mary produced offspring from eggs that were fertilized while they were still inside of her. What makes Mary unique is that her species usually lays eggs which are then fertilized outside of the mother. Mary was close to death when scientists noticed she was pregnant so they put her to sleep and delivered 54 embryos by C-section. Three years later about 20 of her offspring are still alive. This photo shows one of Mary’s babies as a teenager. 📸: Laura Dean/@uniofnottingham

232,,,"Did the great white wipe out the megalodon? A new paper published Wednesday suggests the 60-foot megalodon was actually outcompeted by a smaller savvier predator. The new research says megalodon died off a million years later than previously thought (that's 3.6 million years ago). That means they wouldn't have been part of some mass marine extinction. The earlier die-off date suggests the megalodon existed around at the same time as the great white which means the smaller shark could have easily outcompeted the larger predator. News to chew on. Or chomp on if you're a giant apex predator.

It’s just that that I don't think enough people understand: Valentine's Day is a celebration of love in general not just romantic love. My parents used to get me a Valentine's Day present and I used to get them something too. I give cards to my grandparents and tell my friends I love them more than usual. I hated everyone who was anti-Valentine's Day. I understood that they may not have someone special to share the day with but that didn't mean they couldn't celebrate with family or friends. Why was there a need to wear all black and complain that Valentine's Day is just a Hallmark Holiday just because they weren't in a relationship? To be honest it's kind of insensitive to people who are in relationships. This is a really special day for them so let them make a big deal out of it. Don't make vomiting noises when you walk past couples holding hands. Wish couples Happy Valentine's Days. They'll really appreciate it. Now I'm single and I still love Valentine's Day. I plan on giving my friends Valentines and I'm making some sweet treats for people too. Valentine's Day was created to spread love all types of love. So if you're single spend the day with some friends you love who may or may not be in relationships. Call your family or go home for the weekend if you can. Self-love is important too. Buy yourself something you've wanted for a while. You deserve it! Eat some chocolate drink some wine cuddle a stuffed animal watch a cheesy movie about love in your pajamas. Or dress up! Valentine's Day was also created to recognize how lucky we are to have love in our lives. The feeling of love really is a gift. Once again I'm talking about all types of love even love for a pet so smile and go out there to celebrate your Valentine’s Day. ❤️❤️❤️ Happy Valentine's Day!|@gemt.r|@gemt.r|Megalodon lived in Kern County CA as I understand it great information thank you!|Is there any megalodon DNA in existence??|@elizabethmilflores 😮|That means pretty much nothing whatsoever that the big shark isn't continuing to eat and do what it does regardless of what the hell the smaller great white shark is doing|Stunning shot!|Shark wars|@ewarouland|@megalokaty|Lol shark is a killer whales favorite dinner they ain’t shit|@jheier14 this is cool|A more interesting question would be if homo sapiens wiped out other human species?

The changing colors are due to the movements of phytoplankton or algae. Scientists estimate more than 50 percent of the world’s oceans will see color changes by 2100 as algae populations fluctuate in size. In warmer climates that will mean bluer waters as algae populations fall. Near the poles water will turn deeper shades of green as warmer waters spur algae blooms. 📸: @nasa

241,,,"“Disturbing.” That’s the word @NASA scientists are using to describe the Eiffel Tower-sized cavity growing at the bottom of the Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica. The glacier which is about the size of the state of Florida once contained over 14 billion tons of frozen water. Now huge quantities of this glacier have melted contributing to about 4 percent of global sea level rise.

242,,,"The Polar Vortex -- that's the name for the mass of cold air blowing counterclockwise over the Arctic. It's what's responsible for the frigid temperatures moving south over the continental United States. Yet this extreme cold doesn't debunk the fact that the Earth is getting warmer according to experts. Climate scientists are in agreement that warmer temperatures have become the norm and that anomalies like this winter storm shouldn't distract us from that. ""The basics — it’s getting warmer on average there are more anomalous highs than anomalous lows and there is more intense rainfall — covers 90 percent of the cases” Gavin Schmidt a climate scientist who is director of @NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies tells @NBCNews.

The Cable Spacer Structure.
The patent number: 22077

The CSS is a super light structure based on cable bridges but in reverse for making multi-functional spaces.
The ratio of iron consumed is one kilogramme in every square metre.
In general according to the weight the structure can tolerate both dead and live weight in each end of a rectangular with 3 meters width and 10 meters length.
This structure provides cable texture between the  arches made of iron with the regular distances and the rupture threshold (3 tons in 10 milimeter) this can provide the connection with the ground and holding of the weight.
Since there are no cross bars between the arches the application and the assembling of this structure are done with ease and comfort. 
This structure is reduced to one hundredth from the actual size.
The various applications of this structure are the following:
In small scales: exhibitions crisis camps refugees camps and in larger scales:  storage sheds planting sheds greenhouses and military bases.
In summary it's more cost-effective more dynamic portable  compared with the other known methods.
It is remarkably resistant and weight tolerant if connected well to the ground and it can be built with either concrete or iron sheets on dead and live weights.
This structure has been implemented in 5 places and the stages of building replicas and the calculations of it along with the defending of the patent have successfully been completed.@halilsazeh in facebook  i looking for sponser thanks .|I dare y’all to like my photo for no reason 🤠🖤‼️⚜️|Westerose after the Undead king destroys everything|f***ing beautiful|Cooollaaachh....|GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!|Damnn|Just tremounds😮|Seems rather close to earth for a spare station to take a pic.

They lack in swimming ability and instead use their highly-adapted pectoral fins to ""walk"" on the ocean floor. When they reach maturity their dorsal fins become a single spine-like projection. Like other angler fish the structure on their heads called an illicium is used for attracting prey. (TBH they lured us over with their cute lipstick.)

The Cable Spacer Structure.
The patent number: 22077

The CSS is a super light structure based on cable bridges but in reverse for making multi-functional spaces.
The ratio of iron consumed is one kilogramme in every square metre.
In general according to the weight the structure can tolerate both dead and live weight in each end of a rectangular with 3 meters width and 10 meters length.
This structure provides cable texture between the  arches made of iron with the regular distances and the rupture threshold (3 tons in 10 milimeter) this can provide the connection with the ground and holding of the weight.
Since there are no cross bars between the arches the application and the assembling of this structure are done with ease and comfort. 
This structure is reduced to one hundredth from the actual size.
The various applications of this structure are the following:
In small scales: exhibitions crisis camps refugees camps and in larger scales:  storage sheds planting sheds greenhouses and military bases.
In summary it's more cost-effective more dynamic portable  compared with the other known methods.
It is remarkably resistant and weight tolerant if connected well to the ground and it can be built with either concrete or iron sheets on dead and live weights.
This structure has been implemented in 5 places and the stages of building replicas and the calculations of it along with the defending of the patent have successfully been completed.@halilsazeh in facebook  i looking for sponser thanks .|Nice",4928

It turns out male city frogs have a more complex call that females from both the forest and city prefer. Male forest frogs have a simpler call which means less dates for them. .

264,,,"Mammals aren't the only species that feed milk to their offspring according to a new study. Jumping spiders like the one pictured (no it's not an ant) suckle babies with a fluid containing sugars fats and proteins. Scientists are calling this liquid milk. Spiderlings in the new study didn't leave their nests until 21 days after birth.  Even after that the spiders continued to come back for another 18 days to suckle from the mother. That's led scientists to the question - what other non-mammal species secrete milk to feed their young?

268,,,"Make a wish 💫 The Leonid meteor shower is passing overhead this weekend and it'll peak early Sunday morning. Earth will pass through the thickest part of the Leonid swarm at 7 p.m. EST on Nov. 17. The best time to look up will be after midnight Sunday morning. That's when the radiant - the source the meteors appears to stream from - comes above the horizon for stargazers in North America. The meteors are called the Leonids because they look like they're shooting out of a point located within the Sickle of Leo. .

270,,,"The Antikythera Mechanism. It’s a 2200-year-old analog “computer” that used bronze cogs and levers to predict the phases of the sun and moon. Some say it may have even been capable of calculating the course of planets through the night sky.  Its remains were discovered in a shipwreck just off the small island of Antikythera between Greece and Crete 50 years ago but engineers and mathematicians are still struggling to understand its inner workings. It currently lives at the Archaeological Museum in Athens.

272,,,"This is Najin one of the world’s two remaining northern white rhinos. She and her daughter Fatu are unable to breed naturally. But scientists say hope may not be lost for their species. DNA evidence shows the rhino is more closely related to its southern white cousin than previously thought. Scientists believe they can breed rhino hybrids using in vitro fertilization. The science is complicated and costly – it’ll take another $10 million to complete the research and develop the procedure. Other options to save the northern white rhino include using frozen rhino tissue to generate stem cells that can develop into eggs and sperm.

This particular coloration of pencil urchin is found in Hawaii but other variations are seen throughout the tropical waters from the east coast of Africa to the Pacific archipelagos.

Belugas are listed as “near threatened” by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature due to human activity and climate change.

289,,,"It’s pretty to look at but how long will it be around?  This coral garden is part of the larger coral reef in the bay of Beau Vallon Seychelles. The Seychelles have lost up to 90 percent of its coral reefs in some areas due to a process called bleaching where warm waters expel the colorful algae that live within the coral’s skeletons. Without these nutrients the reefs starve. The reefs can restore themselves but overfishing and pollution are keeping the threat alive.

290,,,"A microscopic look at cancerous cells. In contrast to normal cells cancer cells do not stop growing and they don't communicate with other cells. They do not undergo apoptosis – the process of cell death – when they are damaged or get old. Unlike normal cells they don't secrete the sticky substance that makes them stick together in a group which is what allows them to migrate to other parts of the body. Their shape is abnormal and they can sneak past the immune system long enough to grow into tumors.

The ridges in the stone can be attributed to changes in the winds during the Jurassic period and the erosion that followed. Because the sandstone is so soft the ridges are fragile and visitation to the Wave is limited. Only 20 visitors are allowed per day and permits are assigned through a lottery. .

292,,,"Science is all around us even in the most ordinary things. This is what light looks like when it’s reflected off soap film the thin  soapy material that creates bubbles. The colors are caused by the interference of light reflecting off of two surfaces that are very close together – the surface of the film and the surface of whatever's behind the film. When white light hits the film the interference enhances some wavelengths and minimizes others creating a spectrum of colors. .

Well a lot of deep sea fish develop bioluminescence. I wonder why when the cave angel fish saw its environment (when it had eyes) why it wouldn't develop bioluminescence to make use of it's eyes? Why would it devolve? Does this have to do with the deep sea pressure versus the presence of air and lower density waters in caves? One deep sea fish learned it could use bioluminescence to luer other fish to her mouth to eat. 🐉 All very fascinating stuff.|I can see it.|@nikolayreva,4973

320,,,"Cenote. The name meant “sacred well” to the Mayans of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula who believed these pristine groundwater pools were a portal to speak with the gods. The subterranean cenotes were formed by the collapse of porous limestone bedrock. The water in these underground caves has been filtered by earth making it crystal clear for divers. And mineral-rich algae in the water help nourish thirsty skin making them popular destinations for swimmers. This photo shows a cenote system in Dos Pisos just west of Tulum. Where will your weekend take you?

323,,,"Pangolins! They have long tongues. So long in fact that when they’re fully extended they can be up to 16 inches LONGER than the pangolin’s entire body length. In most pangolin species the tongue comes from deep within the chest cavity starting at the last pair of ribs. If you get licked by one good luck. Their long tongues are coated in a sticky saliva that helps them grab their buggy snacks.

Seeing this site in person just a few years ago would have been highly unlikely – international visitors have typically been on business or religious pilgrimages. But the Saudi government says it is opening up the country to mainstream tourism.

327,,,"This is the Rainbow Mountain or Vinicunca as locals in the Peruvian Andes call it. Its bands of turquoise lavender red and gold are composed of sediment created from mineral deposits over millions of years.  This multicolored mountain stands at 16000 above sea level. It was only discovered about five years ago because of climate change. Locals say the mountain was once under snow and global warming has caused the ice to melt revealing the picturesque landscape. The mountain is now a destination for approximately 1000 hikers a day and increased foot traffic has raised concern over damage to the previously untouched ground.

The Red Planet will be at its brightest on the morning of July 31 as it hovers just 35.8 million miles away from Earth. Stargazers will be able to easily see Mars with the naked eye – it’ll be brighter than any other star and nearly as bright as Venus. .

329,,,"At 33000 feet above the ground thousands of bacteria are living in each cubic meter of air. These airborne bacterial cells can actually help clouds form by serving as little platforms for water to cling to. Incidentally aquatic species of bacteria are best suited for seeding clouds in this way. This means that specific bacteria may have evolved for this purpose. Remarkably if that is true then it must also be true that bacteria in the atmosphere can directly affect Earth's weather patterns. 📸 + text by Tiffany Halvorsen (@sunburnedscientist)

It’s one of the more common types of the airborne saprophytic fungi – a type of fungus that gets its nutrients from dead organic matter. It’s usually ground in soil and compost heaps where it helps recycle carbon and nitrogen. Its spores are all over our atmosphere and we inhale about a hundred every day which isn’t a problem for most healthy people but can lead to illness in those with weakened immune systems. . . . . . .

340,,,"This spiky black ooze is called a ferrofluid. The word describes any liquid that’s strongly magnetized in the presence of a magnetic field. The “spikes” are created as the liquid tries to find the most stable shape in order to minimize the total energy of the system. Ferrofluids are made of tiny magnetic fragments of iron suspended in oil (usually kerosene) with a surfactant that prevents clumping (typically oleic acid). More commonly ferrofluid is used to keep hard drives and speakers clean.

It takes the sun 226 million years to completely orbit the center of its galaxy. Astronomers calculate the sun has only completed its orbit 20 times since it formed 4.6 billion years ago. Because the sun is 26000 light-years away from the center of the Milky Way it moves at a speed of 782000 km/hour to complete its rotation.

361,,,"Is it just a case of bad luck or is it Mercury in retrograde? Whatever you believe here’s what it really means when we say Mercury is in retrograde. “Apparent retrograde motion” happens when planets appear to temporarily change the direction of their orbit. While the planets aren’t actually changing course it looks that way from Earth. The retrograde illusion occurs when Mercury which orbits the sun faster than the Earth does laps Earth. It does this about every four months for about three weeks at a time. As Mercury passes us it appears to loop back on itself. Mercury came out of retrograde over the weekend meaning it’s back on track if you're keeping an eye on it from Earth!

362,,,"Dragonflies and damselflies form a heart when they mate. To mate the male grabs the female by the back of her neck with claspers at the end of his abdomen which fit into grooves in the female. The pair will fly like this together for as short as a minute or as long as a few hours. During mating the male might try to scoop out any sperm the female may have in her already with a spoon-like structure on his reproductive organs.

It’s a “sub-auroral ion drift.” Basically ions are flowing quickly from east to west causing the purple streak you see in the sky. It’s closer to the Equator than the northern lights which makes it different from the aurora borealis. .

Listen folks The chicken came first not the egg! Here is the support of my argument from Science Evolutionary Point of View and The Religious Evolutionary Point of View 1. In the Science Evolutionary point of view during the evolution of life all living creatures are already actively moving such examples are the dinosaurs and the fishes in the ocean. There was never an egg of any kind and whatsoever being discovered in the history of science during the first creation or discovery of life. So it is very clear that the chicken came first and hatched the egg.
2. In the Religious point of view God created human in his image and likeness. And then God created animals and other plants for the humans. In the creation of life when God says let there be light then there was light in just a blink of an eye. When God says let there be animals and other living creatures then everything He says appeared to Him instantly.  All kinds of animals are created in whole piece-all ready moving crawling and flying. There was no egg of any kinds. So therefore from both Science and Religious point of view in evolution I came up to the conclusion that the chicken came first not the egg. Flesh came first before the shell either in Science and Religious point of view.

420,,,"For the first time in more than 150 years we’ll be seeing a “super blue blood moon eclipse.” Super because the moon will be at its closest distance to Earth in its orbit. Blue because it’ll be the second full moon in one month. Blood because the light from Earth’s sunrises and sunsets will create a reddish glow on the moon’s surface. All during a total lunar eclipse! 
The eclipse begins at 5:51 a.m. ET. Where will you be?

425,,,"It’s a beautiful photo from above but it belies the chaos underneath – including rare lightning strikes! 
@noaa GOES-16 weather satellite captured this geocolor image of the massive winter storm. 
Called a ‘bomb cyclone’ due to an intense low-pressure system forming quickly much like a hurricane it means high winds form grabbing up the water around it. This winter version has affected most of the Eastern Seaboard and in many areas has brought those high winds storm surges and what could be record-breaking snow accumulations and low temperatures. 
NOAA is also tracking another interesting feature of this winter storm – lightning strikes just like you’d find in a summer storm. We can’t wait to find out what else is discovered about ‘Bomb Cyclone Grayson.”

I asked that you explain because people don't usually spend the time to look things up. I meant to debunk you in front of an audience. Don't avoid the question by discounting me. I'm irrelevant in the overall idea.|Prove yourself as a teacher and explain how this show isn't a display of science because many people follow it as so.|You're an honors/AP biology teacher. Sorry Archduke. Now prove yourself.|@janeorbuch I'm not having a match of insults. And yes two men are fighting with rods. Why? And is there entire show revolving around rod fighting? You said you've never seen them use sterile practice. Have you seen their show or are you just typing without substance?|@janeorbuch Speaking of vocabulary how about grammar Miss?|@janeorbuch I have watched the show. I have seen the scientific method in bloom. You're just a hater and in my opinion an unnecessarily nasty person.|@janeorbuch And you're a little more than a tad bit pretentious. Perhaps it's time for a review?|@janeorbuch I disagree. Watch the show. Actually. Because I don't believe you really have. Not without your arms crossed. Perhaps they're having more fun. Perhaps you should be having more fun. But they taught the scientific method in Elementary school. If you honestly think the show is bereft of that you're a terrible teacher and I'm sorry for your students.|@janeorbuch I'm not concerned with my understanding of the scientific method. And I'm not entirely concerned with yours really. I'm sure you know the most mandatory of definitions especially since it was taught so early on; to children. I'm concerned with the fact that you're saying the show is without it. Because it obviously uses it. I mean they* Those experts. You may be an AP teacher but I respect their teachings more than yours eeeeeespecially since you were so abstinent to teaching. So far you've just made statements without explanations or examples.|They boil it down very nicely. Very easy to chew.|@janeorbuch I'm sure it doesn't take years to explain the scientific method.

If I'm so misinformed instead of insulting me inform me; especially as a ""teacher."" So far you've responded poorly.|I'm asking that you provide one example of how the Mythbusters don't use the scientific method.|One example. That should be very easy considering your statement and your actual belief. Is your belief unsubstantiated or can you provide that single example?|So far you've just made broad unclear statements. Also you haven't proven that I'm hard to teach; you haven't even attempted a lesson. If anything you've proven that aside from being nasty you're lazy.|Otherwise legitimately prove me wrong. That too should be very easy since you think I'm an idiot.|@janeorbuch|You have partially explained the scientific method. Let's progress.

532,,,"This is a tricolored bat with a small transmitter glued to its back. I captured this shot while working with Susan Loeb and Pallavi Sirajuddin from Clemson University. It is one of a handful of bats that are getting hit hard from the appropriately named White Nosed Syndrome. It grows on their skin (causing noses and wings to turn white) as they try and hibernate. Because it's uncomfortable they frequently wake up when they should be sleeping. This is causing severe mortality in many bats. In fact just two years ago in this very cave researchers counted 500 bats. Today this was one of three left in this underground system. Let’s hope that it doesn't wipe out an entire species of bats and that soon there might be a way to help find a solution to this problem.

I know at LEAST 5 others besides myself who were upset that all of your myths you played during the Search were repeats of myths already done during the original show. Get cracking you're under the microscope as of now. Good luck!|Congratulations to the new Mythbusters. Don't worry about the pressure to replace someone else. You're not here to be Adam and Jamie.

600,,,Bringing designs to life is the most rewarding part of being a builder! I am often asked by #mythbusterssearch viewers where to start or what it takes to become a builder and the truth is anyone can do it with a passion for design & some practice!

654,,,"From @grantimahara: Something a lot of people don’t know about me is that I spent about a decade performing as #C-3P0 for personal appearances and commercials for #Lucasfilm. As a young kid just starting work at Lucasfilm THX I was approached by my friend Don Bies who was the official archivist at the time. He needed someone to wear the C-3P0 costume and act to a pre-recorded soundtrack provided by the original actor Anthony Daniels. He figured I was about the right size and invited me to the archives to try the suit on.
It was an incredibly strange experience. You’re encased 100% head to toe in fiberglass metal and vinyl. You can barely see hear and breathe. And you can’t sit down.
My first appearance was for an internal licensing event at Skywalker Ranch. After that I appeared as C-3P0 for about a decade and traveled all across the United States and around the world (Mexico Japan Australia Turkey) and shot commercials for Taco Bell Burger King Mitsubishi and LEGO to name a few. I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show and shook hands with celebrities outside the Mann Bruin theater in Westwood CA during the Star Wars Special Edition premiere. .

We made a gigantic parachute of shower curtains and in the final test it did indeed slow Buster to a survivable landing.

656,,,"From @grantimahara: Before #MythBusters I worked in movie special effects at George Lucas’ Industrial Light & Magic. I started at the ILM Model Shop in 1995 on The Lost World (sequel to #JurassicPark). Since I had a background in electronics I worked in animatronics and miniature lighting. Other movies I’ve worked on include Galaxy Quest AI Van Helsing Terminator 3 Matrix Reloaded & Revolutions Star Wars: Episodes 1-3. (You can look up the rest on IMDB.)
Though many people believe that most of the visual effects in the Star Wars prequels were computer graphics actually we had dozens of practical models and sets. One of the biggest models I worked on for #StarWars was the Federation Battleship. I did all the interior lighting including the landing bay. I also did a full retrofit of the R2-D2 fleet and updated a lot of the electronics which was a dream come true for a guy who grew up as a Star Wars superfan.
I also did all the electronics for the second generation Energizer Bunny. I made custom circuit boards and programmed microcontrollers to control the drum beat sequence.
I worked at ILM right up until I started at MythBusters in January 2005.

666,,,"The two galaxies of Arp 299 have been locked in a gravitational conflict for millions of years while their central black holes haven’t yet collided their battle is due relatively soon. Hubble captured the visible light in this image while NuSTAR uses its X-ray vision to create a layer of false-color red green and blue. NuSTAR observed that only one of the two black holes are absorbing matter through a region of gas and dust thus emitting X-rays. In a billion years or so only one composite galaxy will remain and only one central supermassive black hole. Soon thereafter however an additional galaxy may enter the fray. Thus ends our more in-depth look into the varying stages of star formation in nebulas star explosions via supernovas and star collapses/collisions involving black holes. .

Low energy X-rays (red) in the image show expanding debris from the supernova explosion and high energy X-rays (blue) shows the blast wave comprised of a shell of extremely energetic electrons. The data from this image has helped support a theory about how magnetic fields can sometimes be dramatically amplified in such blast waves and could lead to an increased understanding of energetic particles called cosmic waves that bombard the Earth.

You’d have also burned through around 11.8 billion pairs of shoes waling that single lightyear. .

IRAS 2034+4057 spans about one lightyear and lies about 4500 light years away towards the constellation of Cygnus the Swan. The above image was taken in 2006 but only released in 2014. The battle between light and gravity will most likely take over 100000 years to play out. What happens after is anyone’s guess. Clever observations by scientists as NASA and the ESA indicate any new star formed from this star could one day expand into a planetary nebula or could explode in a magnificent supernova. It could additionally cool enough to become a brown dwarf or expand enough to become a more habitable main sequence star.

Most of what you see here are shock waves (fronts where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas).

The name N206 is usually given to the complete nebula but it is also used to mean only a SuperNova Remnant (SNR) located in the nebular complex in its upper part (bubble-like feature). This image has been taken in narrowband and processed with “natural”-like colors being Halpha coded as red and OIII both as green and blue.

It is a very large HII region spanning more than 1000 light years across (compare this with M 42 about 25 light years across). In fact should this nebula be at M42’s distance it would span more than 40 degrees in the sky.

691,,,"M27 is also called the Dumbbell Nebula due to the structure that can be seen in RGB images like the one on the right. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764. This nebula has an approximate age of 10000 years according to spectroscopic measurements expanding at a speed of 31km/sec. It is a typical planetary nebula with a white dwarf in its center. This star has a mass of about 60% of our Sun and about 5% of its diameter.

It consists of three (out of four) Nebula types: Emission Nebula (the red glowing gas) Reflection Nebula (the blue glowing gas) and Dark Nebula (the dark lanes crossing in front of the previous ones). The emission nebula is fueled by several hot stars type O5 to O7. M20 is a young nebula about 300000 years old and is part of the same complex of nebulosity of which the Lagoon Nebula M8 is also part of.

The first step to prep this Magnolia slab for a coffee table is to flatten the top. As the wood dries after it's cut it tends to warp and twist some. The bulk of the flattening was done using my friend's CNC machine (not pictured) and here I'm using my Stanley No. 8 hand plane to flatten and remove the CNC machine marks. .

746,,,"From Rolf Wahl Olsen: ""Omega Centauri is by far the most massive of the about 150 known globular clusters in the Milky Way. Some 10 million stars orbit the center of this cluster. It is also relatively nearby which altogether makes it a most impressive sight.
The cluster spans about 150 light years across and is located some 15000 light years away in the southern constellation Centaurus. It is easily visible to the naked eye and was first cataloged as a star by earlier astronomers. 
In this image I have focused on bringing out the different colours of the stars in this massive globular. The cluster consists mainly of old red giant stars with a sprinkling of very conspicuous blue stars. These are 'blue stragglers' stars that are too hot and massive for the cluster's otherwise old age. Given the ancient origin of the cluster these stars should have turned into red giants by now but it has been proposed that they are the results of mergers and mass transfers in the crowded environment of globular clusters. A main sequence star can exist for billions of years in the cluster and then later gain mass from a close orbiting binary or as a result of a collision/merger and thereby become more massive and hotter so that it now appears as a blue giant."" .

748,,,"From Rolf Wahl Olsen: ""The Jewel Box is an open star cluster visible as a faint smudge with the naked eye under dark skies. It is located 6440 light years away towards the constellation Crux The Southern Cross. The first person to recognise it as a cluster of individual stars was Nicolas Louis de Lacaille during his visit to Cape Town in 1752. The name of the cluster originates from John Herschel's later observations in the 1830's also from Cape Town and his resulting description of it:
""A most vivid and beautiful cluster though neither a large nor a rich one is yet an extremely brilliant and beautiful object when viewed through an instrument of sufficient aperture to show distinctly the very different colour of its constituent stars which give it the effect of a superb piece of fancy jewellery""
The bright orange star in the centre of the cluster is known as Kappa Crucis. It provides a striking contrast with the rest of the hot blue cluster members. Although the cluster is a mere 14 million years young this star has already reached the red giant phase of its life and will most likely explode in a brilliant supernova within the next few million years.""

This particular nebula is a classic favourite among both visual and photographic observers due to its bright and colourful appearance. The complex cloud displays an unusual combination of both red emission and blue reflection areas as well as numerous intricate dark patterns. The nebula is located 9000 light years away in the direction of the Milky Way centre. The entire area is sprinkled with thousands of stars and fainter dusty and nebulous areas throughout. Another dark cloud shows up silhouetted against the starry background to the left of the Trifid.""

This large and bright globular star cluster is the 2nd brightest as seen from Earth only surpassed by the massive Omega Centauri. Both clusters are Southern Hemisphere objects and are easily visible with the naked eye. Of the two I personally consider 47 Tucanae to be the more impressive because of its extremely dense and bright core region which is a spectacle to behold both visually through the eyepiece and photographically as in this image. 
47 Tucanae is located around 17000 light years away in the direction of the Southern constellation Tucana (The Toucan) and appears very close to the Small Magellanic Cloud one of the two prominent satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. The cluster spans an angular diameter larger than the full Moon and is one of the most massive globular clusters home to millions of individual stars contained within its physical diameter of 120 light years."" .

751,,,"From Rolf Wahl Olsen: ""This dramatic pair of interacting galaxies is located in the southern constellation Fornax (The Furnace). The largest NGC 1316 is also known as Fornax A meaning it is the brightest radio source in Fornax (also the fourth brightest in the entire sky). The strong radio emission originates from its central supermassive black hole. 
Visible near its bright centre are many concentric shells that are remnants of past mergers with other galaxies. The formation of such shells is a common observation in computer simulations of merging galaxies. The shells form when the cores of merging galaxies orbit around their common centre of mass in an ever tighter orbit while disrupting the halos of both galaxies and sending billions of stars into eccentric orbits. This process creates outward travelling density waves until the collision eventually settles as one single larger galaxy. Other prominent galaxies display similar shells and one of the finest examples is Centaurus A.""

752,,,"From Rolf Wahl Olsen: ""Pictured against the sprawling star fields and dark clouds of the Southern constellation Puppis are some ghostly glowing structures known as cometary globules. They owe their existence to complex interactions between gas and dust and the intense ultraviolet radiation from young O type stars in their neighbourhood. And possibly also to supernova explosions in the distant past.
Passing shock waves and radiation pressure have interacted with density fluctuations in the interstellar medium and caused the formation of condensations called Bok globules. The radiation is also ionizing Hydrogen gas in the area visible as the faint pink glow while slowly eroding away the condensed globules and blowing their contents out into long tails similar to that of a comet. Radio observations from ESO's La Silla observatory in Chile have shown that the gas in the globules has a temperature of some 5000 to 14000 Kelvin."" .

This is one of the nearest star forming regions and the intricacies of the dense interstellar dust clouds in the area provide a spectacular display of light and shade; the contrasting hues making this one of the most dramatic and colourful patches of the entire night sky. 
Even the brightest parts of this dusty nebulousity are barely noticeable when viewed through large amateur telescopes. This deep exposure brings out the full splendour of the scene and shows the delicately swirling clouds like an expressionist painting on a giant interstellar canvas. 
The bright star is 7.9 magnitude SAO184376 which is the main source of light for the blue reflection nebula. The contrasting red areas are primarily illuminated by the red supergiant star Antares which lies just outside the field of view.""

755,,,"From Rolf Wahl Olsen: ""The Cat's Paw Nebula is located among the dense star fields of the southern constellation Scorpius. Being about 5000 light years distant in the direction towards our galaxy's crowded central region it appears visibly reddened by large amounts of interstellar dust that lie between us and the glowing cloud. This gives it a much warmer deep red hue than most other emission nebulae. Some other nebulae which are similarly obscured are the gigantic NGC 3603 in Carina as well as NGC 6357 (The Lobster Nebula) also in Scorpius.
The Cat's Paw Nebula contains up to 200000 solar masses of material and is currently undergoing a starburst; producing new stars at a very high rate. These newborn stars are the ones that light up the nebula and cause it to glow with the prominent red colour of hydrogen emission. The starburst activity will likely not last more than a few million years after which a number of large star clusters will have emerged and replaced the once glowing gas.""

The Antlia Cluster (Abell S0636) is a compact cluster of galaxies located in the Southern constellation Antlia (The Air Pump). It forms part of the large Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster some 133 million light years distant which makes it possibly the third closest galaxy cluster to our Local Group after the Virgo and Fornax Clusters. 
Over the course of 6 months I used a homebuilt 12.5 inch f/4 Serrurier Truss Newtonian telescope to collect 152 hours exposure on this magnificent and rarely imaged galaxy cluster. With a limiting magnitude of 25 the resulting image reveals most of these galaxies to be gravitationally interacting. Scattered across the background are a vast number of deeply reddened distant galaxies many of which appear grouped into distant clusters of their own far beyond the realms of the Antlia Cluster.""

763,,,"This image is the realisation of a dream of mine: To capture an ultra-deep image with over 100 hours’ exposure. In 2013 I managed to gather more than 120 hours of data on Centaurus A and the result shows this majestic Southern galaxy as it has never been seen before.
Visible are some unique features some of which have never been imaged before by amateurs. These include a set of enormous reddish filaments associated with the relativistic jets; the complete shell structure of the extended halo showing both the faint outer shells and brighter inner ones; 709 of the catalogued globular clusters orbiting the galaxy and Integrated Flux Nebulae permeating the entire field of view around the galaxy.

Up until 1920 most astronomers believed that all of the stars in the universe were contained inside the Milky Way. Following this Great Debate observations by Edwin Hubble proved that the Milky Way is in fact just one of billions of galaxies in the universe. The Milky Way as a whole is moving through space at a rate of approximately 600 km per second and will collide with the Andromeda Galaxy in around 3.75 billion years. . . .

That's Good☺ maybe they mistakenly didn't take electron for granted....
