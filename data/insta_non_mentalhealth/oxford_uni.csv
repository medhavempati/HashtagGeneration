Documents still bear these ghost addresses on them which are now under the sea|Well. For sure there is a change in climate. Here in Poland summers used to be warm but windy so it made one feel mostly chilled. Nowadays (around 10 years later) it's boiling hot with no wind nor rain whatsoever. Also there is less storms than it used to be and if there occurs one it's strong than what I would expect. I realise it could be a time change of weather. But what concerns me is maybe even not the temperature. It's the trash we get rid of every single day be it market food waste or home plastic waste. As for food it is organic so it won't be an obstacle but seriously the amount of wasted food during the harvest market and preparing processes would diminish the world hunger problem. And as to the plastic it is a bigger problem. Simple to produce and keep but later on it is only a waste of space time and health. Not many plastic packages are safe for human health and it works for animals too. I hope that we all will wake up at some point and try to do something for the environment as people and not wait for the organizations to solve the problem.

・・・
Spanish | Indian “When asked how I identify I tend to say Spanish and Indian. On official forms I’m Mixed White/Asian. My Mum’s parents are Indian and my Dad was brought up by his Spanish mother. Being mixed-race is not something I considered until I was about 6 or 7 and my parents were involved in an article for the Independent about the rise of inter-racial marriages. It’s still something I didn’t think I thought about much until my teens.

At first my Grandparents didn’t approve of the fact that my Mum was going to be marrying a White guy but by the time we were kids they had obviously put it all behind them. I was brought up Catholic but we still celebrated Hindu celebrations such as Diwali. We always had to lie to our Indian grandparents if we had to leave their house on a Sunday to go to church.

I love cooking and am obsessed with both Spanish and Indian cuisine. I have spent lots of time in Spain so also love the music of the Spanish speaking world and speak the language. I’m planning on doing some travelling after Uni to get more in touch with my Indian heritage. I’m hoping to do a trip involving going back to Jalandhar the town my family are from and other places of significance to my heritage. There’s a temple on the Ganges in Punjab that has a scroll with all my ancestors’ names on it.

While studying at Oxford I have had some comments regarding my ethnicity there are people wherever you go that will make little comments that they don’t realise are offensive. I have definitely become more aware of my status as a mixed-race individual but in a good way. While at Oxford I have definitely learned to love and appreciate my heritage much more.

If I had the opportunity to be reincarnated I would like to come back just as I am. I now feel very connected to both Indian and Spanish culture and have a great appreciation for them both; more so than British culture. I love London but find it difficult to connect with British values.”",repost,"|Handsome 💛|Mixed tradition to the history of Oxford to the universal to commonwealth to the Britain of the city.|Great...|good luck💛💛💛💛|Thanks for sharing a little bit of you|Brilliant! I was raised in a town near Jalandhar in the state of Punjab and whenever you visit Punjab or in fact any other place in India it will be an experience of a lifetime!

I live in a mostly ""mixed-race"" country so we don't usually pay too much attention to this phenomenon. I'm mixed race myself: Spaniard dark (south) and blond (north) German Portuguese African black. It's believed that there's also some Asian (Chinese or Japanese) traits as well but I didn't inherit those my cousin did. AWESOME HAIR man!

English/Scottish/Nigerian | African/Chinese/European “ I identify as a Christian who is mixed-race and heterosexual. Three of my Grandparents came to the UK from Jamaica and the other was born in Britain. My Mum is of African Chinese and European descent. The African and European parts of my Mum’s roots are spread out from countries all over those continents. My Dad’s racial background is half Nigerian one quarter English and one quarter Scottish. It’s only been within the past year that I have fully allowed myself to embrace this label. But since both my parents are of Jamaican descent I never thought I counted as being mixed-race until recently.

Before I arrived I’d imagined Oxford as a place where I could fall deeper in love with my subject and be pushed in all sorts of dimensions. My heritage was not a factor in my decision to attend. I haven’t experienced any obvious racism in my time here. I find it hard to recognise covert racism. I find it easier identifying that sort of racism retrospectively so if you were to ask me that question in a couple of years’ time I would have an answer. My experience has for the large part been that Oxford is accepting and warm. I do think there is quite a way to go for Oxford to be yet more inclusive both as an institution and as a community. To some extent (and you may think me naïve for saying this) I think that if you are fearful of discrimination and intolerance then you will project these things and find them.

My experiences at Oxford have made me more aware of my status as a non-White person but in a positive and enlightening way as the topic of race is given a platform here whereas where and when I grew up race wasn’t discussed as much. I have felt increasingly represented with the formation of the Oxford Mixed Heritage Society. I’ve n",repost,|Your activity is brilliant!

Postgraduate student Daria and undergraduate student Daphne talk to us about ways we can all help to sustain the environment. In celebration of #WorldEnvironmentDay on 5 June try to do as many of these things as you can moving forward:
- Eat less meat
- Reduce your plastic waste
- Buy local seasonal produce
- Hold clothes swap parties
- Use public transport (or walk)
- Make the most of refills

That’s the question that many Oxford researchers are working to tackle right now including Dr Natalia Ares from our Department of Materials – drawn here by the fantastic @nina.draws.scientists! 
Find out more about our work in quantum computing at http://po.st/QuantumComputing #Repost @nina.draws.scientists ・・・
How can a scalable quantum computer be built?
.
Of the different techniques Dr Natalia Ares from @oxford_uni explores a silicon technique
.
Here a silicon nitride membrane which has been given the moniker ‘silicon nitride drum’ could act as the memory within the system
.
Dr Ares and her group were recently able to characterise the silicon drum at room temperatures eliminating the need for cryogenic freezing
.
Whichever technique prevails it is crucial to understand in which conditions the materials retain their special quantum properties another area which Dr Ares’ research focuses on
.
Understanding the finer details truly has big implications

To the Youth in Europe and North America
The recent events in France and similar ones in some other Western countries have convinced me to directly talk to you about them. I am addressing you [the youth] not because I overlook your parents rather it is because the future of your nations and countries will be in your hands; and also I find that the sense of quest for truth is more vigorous and attentive in your hearts.
I don’t address your politicians and statesmen either in this writing because I believe that they have consciously separated the route of politics from the path of righteousness and truth.
I would like to talk to you about Islam particularly the image that is presented to you as Islam. Many attempts have been made over the past two decades almost since the disintegration of the Soviet Union to place this great religion in the seat of a horrifying enemy. The provocation of a feeling of horror and hatred and its utilization has unfortunately a long record in the political history of the West.
Here I don’t want to deal with the different phobias with which the Western nations have thus far been indoctrinated. A cursory review of recent critical studies of history would bring home to you the fact that the Western governments’ insincere and hypocritical treatment of other nations and cultures has been censured in new historiographies.
The histories of the United States and Europe are ashamed of slavery embarrassed by the colonial period and chagrined at the oppression of people of color and non-Christians. Your researchers and historians are deeply ashamed of the bloodsheds wrought in the name of religion between the Catholics and Protestants or in the name of nationality and ethnicity during the First and Second World Wars. This approach is admirable.
By mentioning a fraction of this long list I don’t want to reproach history; rather I would like you to ask your intellectuals as to why the public conscience in the West awakens and comes to its senses after a delay of several decades or centuries. Why should the revision of collective conscience apply to the distant past #letter4you|❤️|I wish..|Love Oxford 🔥 it's my dream to a artist of Oxford and one I will be there so wait for me @oxford_uni|https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqdaqlEHXBe296POUpHEnA|Beautiful scenery💗💗💗|😍👌🏻|😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍|@liseybelle 😭 they’re back|❤️|Always loved the wadha|Always loved the Wadham gardens when my son was there.|nice picture|👌✌👍|Antarkan sindy kesini mo😹 @mawarmawir07|Semoga kuliah disini aminnn|InshaAllah will come soon here|❤️❤️|🎈|Follow us for daily pulmonary pearls please 🙏🏻|O paraíso existe 👏🔝|wwwaawwwww|❤️|❤❤❤",7657

OXFORD INTERVIEW TIME 🙈📚🎓🙈 The waiting is over and the time has come for many of you to head to @oxford_uni 🎓I had a tummy full of butterflies the whole journey down and barely uttered a word 🙈I then arrived at Magdalen and was totally overwhelmed by the unreal architecture grand rooms and the massive accommodation I was put in which was literally the size of my house 😂🙈On arrival I was asked to fill in a book list of every text I had read in the last year (yes really do expect the unexpected!) Then at 7pm we were called into a huge dining room and met the tutors who would be interviewing us the next day. We handed over our book lists and as I looked around the room at the (60!!) other interviewees I was certain they were all SO MUCH CLEVERER than me and that the tutors had surely made a mistake...I shouldn’t have been invited to interview! 🙈If any of this sounds like you it is totally normal and try not to panic! You are ALL in the same boat everyone is nervous (some people are just better at hiding it!) ☺️Interviews are also a time to enjoy being in a beautiful university (just look at this library by @pespan 📸😍) discussing a subject you love and to explore the wonderful city of Oxford so in between being a bundle of nerves (I can’t take that away!) try to enjoy it the best you can 🎈Getting an interview is a brilliant achievement and whatever happens next you should be so proud - I am so proud of each and every one of you who has got in touch over the last few weeks ☺️The @thatoxfordgirl team are rooting for you 🤞🤞🤞

Transgenic approaches for
cyanogen reduction in 
For cassava to become a safe and
acceptable crop it is necessary to reduce
the cyanogen levels in cassava foods. While
this objective can be achieved by processing
procedures recent findings have shown
that it is also possible to achieve it by
suppression of cyanogen synthesis or by
accelerating cyanogen turnover and
volatilization. In 2003 cyanogen-free
cultivars were generated by selective
inhibition CYP79D1/D2 gene expression.
The CYP79D1/D2 enzymes catalyze the
first-dedicated step in cyanogen synthesis.
Tissue-specific inhibition of CYP79D1/D2
expression in leaves lead to a 99%
reduction in root cyanogen levels
indicating that the cyanogenic glycoside
linamarin is synthesized in leaves and
transported to roots. An alternative strategy
to the reduce cyanogen content is to
enhance cyanogen detoxification and
cyanide volatilization during processing.
This strategy has the advantage that
cyanogen levels in unprocessed roots are
not altered potentially providing protection
against herbivory andlor theft. To produce
cultivars that promote rapid cyanide
volatilization hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL)
which catalyzes the last step in
cyanogenesis was overexpressed in roots.
Elevated HNL activity resulted in a 3-fold
increase in the rate of cyanogen turnover.
Importantly the cyanogen content of the
transformed and wild-type plants was
identical a potential benefit for farmers.|Dientes @_martaaag|👀|Great|Looking for a sugar baby to take care of I don't talk much just inbox me and please USA and CANADA only..please and please to avoid waste of my time..Serious minded babbies for Daddy|Ofcours  they did that on oxford..|@_.enriiquee._  de eso mismo estaba hablando @riverakiko en su última entrevista|😍|آیا اطلاع دارید که رنگها هم حرف می زنند ؟؟؟ پیامی که رنگها ارسال می کنند بسیار اثر گذار تر از بعضی کلمات است

Perspective: “I come from a (not very good!) state school and have found the step up academically very challenging. Despite these challenges I have really enjoyed my experience at Oxford so far and the staff have all gone above and beyond to ensure that I succeed and feel happy here. As one of the Junior Common Room Disability Officers having Asperger’s Syndrome I have also been active in the college to try to help other students. I have come a long way and do not consider my ‘condition’ to be negative in any way; I had some issues when I was younger including struggling at school to find friendships and bullying issues. I thought that I might face some issues of class at university or not be accepted for other reasons. Although I have sometimes had to point out the limited opportunities I had at school to some tutors they have been extremely helpful when realising my gaps; I have also been fortunate enough to receive travel grants to visit Italy and shall be visiting Greece in the summer opportunities I would not have had and would not have had without the grant awards. I am functioning independently at university and have made good friends; I feel I have come out of my shell even going to night clubs for the first time something I would never have done a couple of years ago!” Charlie 2nd year Classics",mondaymotivation repost,|You are really inspiring.

Tracking the origin and spread of emerging epidemics
•
It took just a few months for Zika to spread across over 50 countries and territories in the Americas. The virus was first detected in the continent in May 2015 following a series of explosive outbreaks in the Pacific islands. But where and when did the recent epidemic begin and how rapidly is the virus evolving? Were the birth defects seen since October 2015 the consequence of newly acquired virus mutations?
•
•
To answer these and other questions we designed the ZiBRA project and set out to trace the evolutionary history of Zika across the Americas identify the origins of the epidemic and track patterns of virus transmission in the most severely affected areas. In June 2016 our team equipped and drove a mobile molecular and genomic laboratory for 2000km across the Atlantic coast of Brazil. In two weeks we tested 1400 samples from pregnant women and their newborns in the main central public health laboratories. •

Spring is in the air! This bright and beautifully painted dish was made in İznik Turkey under the Ottoman Empire. It is made from fritware and decorated with polychrome underglaze paint.⠀
⠀
With the rise the ceramics industry in Turkey İznik became the nation's centre of production for simple earthenware pottery. Early 16th-century İznik wares were influenced by the blue and white porcelain of Ming-dynasty China and by Persian wares as can be observed here. These were traditionally painted with stylised and symmetrical designs of flowers leaves and fruits along with abstract linear motifs.⠀
⠀
By the mid-16th century the range of colours used in the decoration had expanded to include turquoise green purple black and later red. The quality of İznik ware declined in the 17th century and by 1800 manufacture had ceased.⠀
⠀
Dish with flower sprays. Iznik Turkey c. 1530 - 1550. Fritware with polychrome underglaze painting.⠀

Perspective: “Before coming to Oxford I was absolutely terrified. I came from a state comprehensive in the North of England and I didn't know anyone else from my school who was going to go or had previously gone to Oxford. I was so worried that I wouldn't fit in or that I would be totally out of my depth but actually I found the college environment so totally welcoming. It was hard at the start because lots of people already had friendship groups from their school who came here and there were points when I did feel isolated. However within a couple of weeks I made the friends that I still have today a year and a half later and I found that even though I didn't go to a posh school or have to same previous opportunities that they had I was in no way less intelligent.” Ruth 2nd year English",repost,|👍🙌🙏|I had exactly the same experience as you (state school in the North East) going to St Hilda’s in the 1980s.

Two rough moments that stand out are when I called mental health services and was told “This is a really busy time for us” with the implication that my call wasn’t a priority and the person I spoke to repeatedly called me by the wrong name. The previous term I missed my Principal’s Collections due to my depression and was scolded instead of anyone asking if I was ok. Mental health support isn’t just accommodating people who proactively ask for help. It is also noticing accommodating and mitigating the symptoms of mental health and overall creating a supportive community.|Awesome 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍|Go Gregg, Dan, Margaret and Waverly!!!",2239

We are so delighted to announce that Professor David MacDonald has been named as a global finalist for lifetime Award for Conservation Excellence. Don’t these photos tell a wonderful story about a long career dedicated to conservation?
•
•
Professor MacDonald says that if he wins the award money will contribute to a field study of animals cruelly persecuted for illegal trade and towards the sponsorship of a doctoral studentship on the impact of the human population explosion on wildlife.
•
•
“Of course people who know little of conservation imagine it to be a cosy and cuddly subject but that is not the understanding of anybody who appreciates that conservation is actually about how people in the 21st Century (8 billion or so of them from peasants to presidents) wish humanity to live alongside wildlife and the environment and hence is about deep choices that affect every single citizen – this is not easy stuff!” - Prof MacDonald.

264,,,"‘Many relics that we study turn out to date to a period somewhat later than the historic attestation would suggest. This bone fragment in contrast suggests that we could possibly be looking at remains from St Nicholas himself.’ Could ancient bones suggest #Santa was real?
New Oxford University research has revealed that bones long venerated as relics of the saint do in fact date from the right historical period. Using a micro-sample of bone fragment Professor Tom Higham and Dr Georges Kazan the Directors of the Oxford Relics Cluster at Keble College's Advanced Studies Centre have for the first time tested one of these bones. The radiocarbon dating results pinpoint the relic’s age to the fourth century AD - the time that some historians allege that St Nicholas died (around 343 AD). The results suggest that the bones could in principle be authentic and belong to the saint: http://po.st/l0Zn2l",santa,|❤❤❤|But he’s alive.

It feels like just the other day that I was going through the application process from entrance exam to interview to waiting anxiously for my offer letter.

333,,,Don't forget to tune in to the Oxplore Facebook Live at 3pm today! 🎥 We will be discussing the question 'Would you want to live forever?'. Write your question about living forever below for a chance to hear your query being answered by researchers! http://po.st/1ELgiI #Oxplore #BigQuestions #FacebookLive #Oxford #OxfordUniversity,oxplore bigquestions facebooklive oxford oxforduniversity,"|In what context is this question being answered? If one was to live forever would they retain the mind and body of a young agile person or would they just grow old indefinitely?|No. Quality of life while we are here is infinitely valuable. (Socio economic power grab crushes that) good legacy new value systems needed- now that is living forever!|Even if you could live forever and you don't die out of air pollutions there wouldn't be enough space for you the live on the earth .unless you fictionally live in another planet and probably have different needs than a normal human .my question is: (according to evalution theory) natural circumastances can lead to mutation .like the effect that antibiotics have on MRSA that indeed cause the Bacteria to be Resistant and gene exhanged . Is it possible that we as humen will be able to make our bodies resistant to the polluted environment in the future just like a Bacteria reacting to AntiBiotics? If so will the new generation of humen be able to live forever?|Definitely not the key is that you know you're going to die!|Who would be included in this concept of eternal life? Monkeys? Apes? Trees? Protozoons? Wouldn't we be looking for space desperately? And might there be people working as killers - eliminating everyone over 200 years? Could you bribe those? Rich people would really be able to live forever (as long as they are rich) - poor people would starve die from some disease or get killed by the rich. I think it would be pretty awful to live in a world where everybody could live forever... But if just I was living forever?|what would be the environment conditions if we live forever?|If everybody lived forever that would pose a problem impossible to solve for the system ""planet earth."" That system was designed (if it was designed) for life which is a concept including death. Life without death would be impossible under known circumstances on our planet for even if humans were biologically immortal they would still destroy themselves by killing each other. In fact that would be necessary to make enough space on the planet. So the idea of everybody being immortal at the same time and living on earth is impossible. But the question is ""would YOU want to live forever?"" What if you were the only person to ""survive death"" and everyone else around you would perish? That would be interesting but at the same time very lonely. Lonely not in the sense of being alone but rather in the sense of living as an alien among the human species for what ultimately connects all humans is their mortality. The concept of an infinite life seems just as pointless to me as that of a finite one. In my opinion it would be psychologically unbearable to live forever and thus death (supposing it means permanent loss of consciousness) would be a rather pleasant idea. My question is whether the human brain is even able to imagine such a concept as infinite lifetime when at the same time living with the innate notion of death.  @flyingminky|Won't you share a video? I missed the live 😢😭😭😭|Visit us if you want to learn Business German English and Russian 🇩🇪🇬🇧🇷🇺🤗🤝!|Great reflection|If you were to live forever is there ways that you could stop or slow down the aging aspect? What are the problems for the body if you were to live forever?|Here's a question what would happen with the memories? Do you think they would be stored externally? Second would immortality be given only to a few and be granted based on a set criteria? Would that lead to class segregation... what an awesome question... how close are we to actually achieving it?|I've written an 'Ultimate Guide To Brain & Body Wellness For Students' on my Instagram. Hope you get a chance to read it! 🌻|Absolutely I would want to live forever. The problem with this video is that it assumes that things remain as they are. But problems are soluble. We will find solutions to all the things mentioned on the video. Imagine the progress of knowledge that could happen with people living forever and not having their life work cut short. Take any of history's great minds who continued to work into their old age and imagine what could have been accomplished by them if they had just lived another 10 50 100 years.|My thoughts are often in this direction. video quality to be seen with its classical music and I like it. the question is Would you want to live forever? actually we want. but the whole life is already there that governs the most noble substance = God. and if we don't want to live forever it will be sad because remembering the many memories we have passed through the world from babies we don't even see but parents childhood adolescence adulthood and future. I've read all the comments here and all have a great idea. sometimes I am confused humans are given free oxygen by God good body shape eyes to see mouth to say a good sentence feet for walking anywhere will be destroyed if God has said it's time to leave the world. creepy if imagined meaning that human beings are given the opportunity by God to become world leaders with creative ideas coming only 1x applies in the world should be used very well. my lecturer always said the phenomenon of the ancient red threads will never break up to this day and forever will continue to repeat. and I think right except the apocalypse. @oxford_uni|hai oxford contact us",1146

Soon I was taking my sketchbook everywhere with me along with my books and revision notes as I'd be sure to see something I'd want to scribble down when walking through town.

#tardigrade an eight-legged micro-animal will survive until the Sun dies. A new study has shown that the tiny creatures will survive the risk of extinction from all astrophysical catastrophes and be around for at least 10 billion years – far longer than the human race. Tardigrades are the toughest most resilient form of life on earth able to survive for up to 30 years without food or water and endure temperature extremes of up to 150 degrees Celsius the deep sea and even the frozen vacuum of space. The water-dwelling micro animal can live for up to 60 years and grow to a maximum size of 0.5mm best seen under a microscope. Researchers from the Universities of Oxford and Harvard have found that these life forms will likely survive all astrophysical calamities such as an asteroid since they will never be strong enough to boil off the world’s oceans.

Health warnings in Iceland focused on the primary plume but did not mention the older secondary plume. Flying unnoticed this plume had matured and circled back to Icelandic cities and towns long after the initial alert had been lifted. Exposure to it could potentially cause serious human health problems and exacerbate long term conditions such as asthma. It is estimated that whether human-made or from natural sources short and long-term exposure to such particles causes over three million premature deaths per year worldwide.

393,,,Merritt Moore or @physicsonpointe is a quantum ballerina ✨She has achieved what some would call ‘the impossible’: a career as a professional ballet dancer and as an academic quantum physicist. Having quite literally danced her PhD she is just months’ away from completing her degree in quantum and laser physics. Immediately after graduation she will fly to China to perform at the Beijing National Theatre. Having danced since childhood she sees great crossover between dance and quantum physics. Earlier this year she combined her passions collaborating on a meditative science-influenced virtual reality experience called Zero Point Virtual Reality which is currently running at the Barbican Theatre.

The Ashmolean has just acquired a magnificent group portrait painted in Oxford during the Civil War by William Dobson (1611–46). Elias Ashmole the founder of the Museum joined us today to unveil his 400th birthday present.

Don't forget to book your tickets for Ashmole's birthday party this Friday night!

Commissioned in the winter of 1645–6 the painting is a unique artefact of the English Civil War and shows a meeting between three Royalist commanders who were based in Oxford home to the royal court in exile. The group in the painting are Prince Rupert (the King’s nephew) Colonel William Legge (Governor of Oxford) and Colonel John Russell (commander of the prince’s elite Blue Coats). The portrait is the first work by William Dobson to enter an Oxford collection. Read lots more about it under the 'news' section of our website.

434,,,"Over the course of six years the team from Oxford’s Department of Zoology in collaboration with the London Institute of Zoology used miniature tracking devices called geolocators to track the migratory movements and behaviour of 12 pairs of Atlantic Puffins breeding on Skomer Island Pembrokeshire. 
They assessed if and how much pairs’ migratory strategies were related to their future breeding performance and fitness.

A key finding of the study is that pairs which followed more similar migration routes bred earlier and more successfully the following spring showing that there is a clear benefit for puffins to migrate close to their mates. This proximity may make it easier for pairs to synchronise their return to the colony in spring.

461,,,"What inspires me to keep going when times are tough:

Acceptance. On my first big adventure (cycling 16000km from Malaysia to London) I realised that this was not a physical journey but a mental one. 
Of course we all have shit days. That's part of being human. It's grit that keeps us going - and the knowledge that whatever emotion you're feeling at a particular time will change. I give a lot of talks now about chasing adventure not happiness as ironically I think it makes us happier in the long run.

For example I've worked as an anchor and TV reporter in Hong Kong covering news and economics reported on the Malaysian election for the Telegraph photographed Mongolia's naadam festival for BBC Travel paraglided with birds of prey in Nepal hiked across part of a desert in Jordan and interviewed remote tribes in the Amazon. 
I've never really planned my career but have always followed what I'm interested in. Travel and connecting with people around the world lights me up and hopefully that shows in my work.

465,,,"My morning at work: 🌄

I work for myself so there's no real thing as a typical morning. Recently I was filming a travel documentary in the Amazon looking at how deforestation impacts the indigenous tribes that live there. To get around we cycled took boats and terrifyingly small planes across Brazil and Peru. A typical morning in the jungle might involve finding an excuse as to why I didn't want to eat monkey for breakfast - or cycle! A top culinary tip I learned in the rainforest though - if you run out of toothpaste ants and termites make a minty alternative! 🌴🌿 If I am in London there is less time spent munching insects and more time in front of a computer screen. I spend most of my week working as Red Bull's Adventure Editor which involves writing and editing stories about exciting exploits - and getting itchy feet as a consequence. 📹💻 #InstagramTakeover #alumni #oxford @pipstewart @oxfordalumni",instagramtakeover alumni oxford,|First.

According to the Azerbaijani side as well as Memorial Human Rights Center Human Rights Watch and other international observers the massacre was committed by the ethnic Armenian armed forces reportedly with help of some military personnel of the 366th CIS regiment apparently not acting on orders from the command. The death toll claimed by Azerbaijani authorities is 613 civilians including 106 women and 63 children. The event became the largest massacre in the course of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Western governments and the western media refer to it as the ""Khojaly massacre"" ""Khojaly tragedy"" or the ""Battle for Khojaly"". Azerbaijani sources occasionally refer to the massacre as ""Khojaly genocide"" (Azerbaijani: Xocalı soyqırımı) and the ""Khojaly tragedy"" (Azerbaijani: Xocalı faciəsi).|❤️|Woooow I love nature.

The series also features Astrophysicist Professor Chris Lintott English Literature scholar Professor Dame Hermione Lee and Wildlife Conservation expert Professor David Macdonald.

But usually there is at least a smudge of guilt|To blame someone can be helpfull . That can be used to make person stronger. It depends on situation. So a week person brakes apart  goes in to depression being aggressive and starts to blame other people. But the other type I call stronger  because they don't run away from this  you they start to use their mind and finds the way out .|Insecurities about ones own shortcomings but depends on the situation|U can also manipulate people if you blame them and they react to it  then this person is in your hands|Byword|Blaming someone is passing the guilt from yourself (or the person you are protecting) onto another person. Blaming someone may be seen as worthless as it has happened so move on however when the blame comes with reparations it can be seen as tactical to blame someone else.|A bad situation or guilt|It is a self defence method I think. The people blame in order to clear themselves and not to be seen guilty in the society's eyes.

In many instances we're blaming someone else due to the fact that we don't want to fail or be considered to source of a problem. This standard also incorporates fears and lack of integrity which we choose to put before honesty because of these unrealistic standards.|Haydi bakalım @gatekin|Self-satisfaction.. It's in our nature to opt for what makes us feel even a tad bit better.|To maintain monopoly by keeping your competitors at bay|I think that people blame each other explicitly out of fear. Everyone wants to feel safe and when their comforts are compromised nobody wants to undergo that so people blame others. The lack of courage in certain individuals makes them feel the need to always blame others but ones with integrity sometimes place the blame upon themselves for their wrongdoings. Also factors such as one's motive and intentions give people the idea that blaming someone else will allow them to reach their goals morals aside.|@tomxie235 gl|Action or reaction of someone's action which cause for a damage.|so many factors come into act but to answer this question it is sheer absence of responsibility of one's actions.|The word ""blame"" comes with negative connotations. Blaming someone is perhaps a form of denial that you yourself are not to blame. It's an action that results in a sense of relief a lightening of one's load perhaps. Blaming someone else is a way of hiding from the dirty truth.|Fault|Generally Donald Trump is involved|Fear or to maintain some point or status.|Avoid the punishment when children from parents when adult from society|In my opinion to blame someone et have to believe that he/she is at fault. I also think that blaming someone in a way demonstrates our own fear of being blamed or our need to associate actions with people (example: crying-baby). However this depends on whether or not that person is truly to be blamed . Our opinions and moral may also play a role in whether or not to blame someone.|Ignorance|Pride|A lack of trust in some cases or the betrayal of trust|Love|anger|@csharrison1|People do not want to accept that they are wrong!

Sometimes as easy and as fast as seconds! So why not?|The comfort of realising ourselves from our own wrong decisions.|To blame someone is to take the fault or the burden off oneself and place it in someone else. Blaming someone else allows us to let go of the responsibility and it frees us from the weight of the situation|Sin|same thing involved in pleasing ourselves.content|Saying that someone else is in the wrong and that it was their action(s) that caused a bad situation.

Couldn't blame others because there's always a hidden reason that we don't know that urged them to do things that people considered as a bad deeds. Should do some at least 'little research' to know the reason behind it. It is way easier and could avoid to hurting others to blame ourself because at least we knew what the hidden reason is in our self. But sometime it was blocked by our own ego and not knowing the trueself.|@nxmra_x  yasss😁|It has two major purposes!!

The inability to claim responsibilty for the consequences of your actions.|Self intropection|...we right to blame or not|Selfie|Self-satisfaction. Finding the culprit is the only answer|Blaming has a negative connotation to begin with. It is placing direct responsibility of an action or event on another in the attempt to alleviate their own anxiety about the cause. The danger of this is that the  person doing the blaming is not fully getting to the heart of the problem because there is never only one cause. It's an easy way out.

Further as the elder child they may help the younger child with homework that they've already completed in the past teaching as learning simultaneously. Moreoverpsychologically speaking this simply could be marked as the birth order effect.

Most of the time the parents spend more time in the oldest sibling and give him or her more attenion. The younger siblings will think the oldest sibling is the smartest and score lower.

For example they discover facts for themselves by reading rather than finding out from a parent. They teach information to the younger sibling and the teaching process strengthens knowledge and brain power.

The obvious point to realise is their age - more life experience gained at an older age although I appreciate the question is targeted at a fair test with the same variables (IQ test taken at the same age).

First the parents are still young and have energy and project their ambitions upon their first born more so than the later children. As they have more children they are generally not as tough and strict on them because they choose more nurturing approaches to child bearing with time and age. They expect the first child to rise to the occasion and do not settle for ""second best"". Secondly the first child has a superiority complex in relation to the younger siblings which drives and pushes their endeavors. @yirtorres|Let us assume that the older and younger slings are equally the same IQ when they were born except the fact of high IQ at very beginning. Also along with another assumption which is that they are texted IQ when when they are in the same age. Because the older one gets more attention from their parents which usually parents will pay much more attention with their first child the older one explore to a more various environment. @oxford_uni actually whe I went down to here I realised that the question missed a lot of condition which makes less sense. And it won't get that much credit to be a question on interview.|The very moment the second child is born the first child is thrust into a leadership role. We often learn more and learn better when we know we must teach it to someone especially when is it is someone we love. The first child must lead the second in the ways of the world so they may survive therefore the first child naturally learns more of the world strategically as well as educationally. I will help my little brother with his homework from Mr. Glover's history class because I took it 5 years before. This helps me learn as I teach him. I will help my little brother understand our ageing parents to comfort and inform him enforcing this in my mind as well. It is not the age difference that makes the first child have a higher IQ score but rather the need and drive to help our younger siblings survive and thrive in the world.|Subject: Experimental Psychology
Interviewer: Kate Watkins St Anne's College

Q: A large study appears to show that older siblings consistently score higher than younger siblings on IQ tests. Why would this be?

Kate: This is a question that really asks students to think about lots of different aspects of psychology and we guide students when discussing it to think about both scientific factors such as maternal age (mothers are older when younger siblings are born – could that play a role?) and observational analysis about how birth order might affect behaviour and therefore performance on IQ tests. It's a great question because students begin from the point they are most comfortable with and we gradually add more information to see how they respond: for example noting that the pattern holds true even taking into account things like maternal age. This can lead them to think about what the dynamics of being an older sibling might be that produce such an effect – they might suggest that having more undivided parental attention in the years before a sibling comes along makes a difference for example. Then we introduce the further proviso that the effect isn't observable in only children – there is something particular to being an older sibling that produces it. Eventually most students arrive at the conclusion that being an older sibling and having to teach a younger sibling certain skills and types of knowledge benefits their own cognitive skills (learning things twice in effect). But there isn't really a 'right' answer and we are always interested to hear new explanations that we haven’t heard before. What we are interested in is the kinds of reasoning students use and the questions they ask about the study – what it takes into account what it might not – that tells us about their suitability for the course. And of course it doesn't matter if you have a sibling or not – though depending on family dynamics that can add an interesting twist to the conversation!

And so I developed a kind of skill (much like a second-nature) of always having high standards for myself. And with hard work I started seeing improvements in my work and grades and once I got higher grades I didn't ever want to achieve anything less. So I carried on with striving for the top. But then my sister has an older sibling to look up to and so I guess she saw what grades I was achieving and she thought she'd get the same or similar automatically. So that was the first 'straw' to her being less academically strong as I was (because she thought she'd automatically also get high grades) and the second 'straw' was that she didn't want to be compared to me - and so did many things differently to how I did such as not studying the way I did and not acting the way I did - also causing a deficiency in motivation for work (because she had not been inspired to try as hard to get to the top since she didn't have that fear of being incapable because I had achieved high grades so she expected similar results and so she didn't build that little 'aspiration block' in her mind to try hard.) and I am sure I could write an essay (I might just do that...) about this because this question has awoken a huge thought process in my mind which I will pursue and think deeper about.  Thank you Oxford for this question and I hope you liked my partial answer to this intense question. 😊|thiss @nstar963|As the older children they use to face everything on their own.

For instance 'Ingrid Barbendererde' is a novel written during the GDR Regime. It is not political in the sense that it explicitly expresses positioning on political issues. The author Uwe Johnson much more implies criticism by showing how the regime affects personal intimate parts of life that are not even governed over by any institution. Even during an earlier literary era (Naturalism) authors would very vividly describe the living situation of factory workers.

To get back to our discussion I'd like to comment on your point that the political aspect has to be 'long lasting'. What is long lasting defined by? Usually in literature motives (such as the Sandman in the novel of the same name; romanticism) carry certain arguments in a novel. An example for that would be in Georg Büchners play 'The Death of Danton' the savage bloodthirsty nation. It appears in the beginning climax and epilogue of the novel. But compared to the examples I gave in my first comment 'Dantons Death' is an explicitly political work dramatizing the French Revolution. The motive of the Savage nation is long lasting and political certainly. But in other novels perceived as political such motives do not occur 'long lasting'. In 'Ingrid Barbendererde' the conflict ignites out of a political context instead of explicitly stating a an opinion the characters ingest what happened (a girl got kicked out of school for participating in he wrong organisation) subjectively. I would argue that here we can distinguish between a motive that keeps on occurring and a conflict that occurs once and then shifts form and meaning. What connects them is their innate political meaning yes there I agree with you but that does not need to be a long lasting theme or motive in the novel or play.|Makes a novel ( politic ) which politic have many story through to made a new persfective ; however  politic has bad things to material discusstion .|When the political is not reduced to aesthetics but an even play between the two with higher regard and desire for revolution.

I believe the last part is where we differ.  Now while I have not personally read that book what I can deduce from what you have said that the initial political conflict influenced the entirety of the book.

My argument is that such an understand of what is a political play is too narrow. While model of a political play certainly applies to any literary work classically perceived as political (such as The Death of Danton) it cannot be applied to other political novels thereby the categories you raised for what constitutes a political play are insufficient. Full disclosure: in the novel a the ordinary life of a group teenagers in the GDR regime is described. A conflict arises when a girl decides to leave a state sanctioned youth organisation for its opposed youth organisation. The school later decides to expell her. The school as an explicit political institution does not reappear the way in classical political literature motives reappear throughout the novel. Thereby it is different in nature from 'The Death of Danton'; it still is political. An example for politically underlined novels where political institutions are not mentioned at all are the majority of novels about British factory workers. But these cannot be understoof without their political anti-capitalistic undertone so they also have to viewed as political. To conclude again my model for a political play extends to the inner works of either an explicitly described social or political situation (your model) or one that is solely implied or indirectly alluded to (my extension of your model) affecting the protagonists in any aspect of their lives.|The aspect of policy law order and systems of a country's rule written out in the form of a characters words or descriptions of conditions for the novel.

Interviewer: Chris Norbury The Queen's College

Q. About 1 in 4 deaths in the UK is due to some form of cancer yet in the Philippines the figure is only around 1 in 10. What factors might underlie this difference?

Chris: This is a typically open question with no single 'correct' answer which aims to stimulate the sort of discussion that might be encountered in a tutorial teaching session. The discussion could take any one of a number of directions according to the candidate's interests. Some candidates will ask useful clarifying questions such as 'Where do these data come from and how reliable are they?' or 'What is the average life expectancy in these parts of the world?'. Some candidates will seize on the idea that various aspects of the typical lifestyle in the UK are inherently unhealthy which can make for an interesting discussion in itself. Others especially if they appreciate that life expectancy in the Philippines is substantially lower than in the UK will realise that other causes of death are more common in the developing world and that this is the major factor that gives rise to the difference alluded to in the question. This probes selection criteria including problem-solving critical thinking intellectual curiosity communication skills ability to listen and compatibility with the tutorial format.

This is probably the greatest difference and may give rise to a certain environment that can increase the risk of cancer. In the broadest sense a UK man would be exposed to quite different day to day environmental pathogens and environmental stimuli such as industrialised chemical cleaners carcinogens ect. However it may just be that the medical assistance within the UK being a western culture could identify cancer much more readily than a developing nation.

Secondly processed foods and sugar are known for being carcinogenic as are tobacco and pollution four things the UK almost certainly has more of than the Philippines and definitely more of than the less urbanized islands. Increased exposure to dangerous rays from technology is also a potential factor but the one I find the least likely.|The population density and the type of lifestyle that they have of course like the food how healthy they are and the contamination|@alice_notti lol if I was asked this I'd probably cry|Are we going to be receiving answers for the previous question?|The Philippine's is a developing country urbanized industry there in comparison to the UK is very low. Furthermore more sunlight and the larger agricultural opportunities in the Philippines provides more reason for physical activeness which relates to lower health risks other than cancer. Also as a result of the large agricultural background the prosumable outcome is that more fresh organic and probably healthier food is consumed as opposed to the majorly processed industry and fast food that is enjoyed in the UK. Moreover a really simple factor could be tanning? In the UK a bit of sun results in the reliance on radiation for a tan whereas in the phillipines sun shine and a natural tan is a)common ground b) least of their worries.|@mrbalatbat|There are a lot less people coming into Philippine from outside world. And moreover genetically they are healthier as it wasn't Philippine were the industrial revolution started. More than anything I believe its karma.|@mahomiemahi don't be surprised if no answers are posted because km guessing that this is more about a person's approach than having one correct answer. They don't want everyone to say the same thing.|Maybe there are several epidemiological reasons. One could  be the fact that cancer is a multi-step mutation process increasing with age when cells become more susceptible to accumulate genetic mutations... the life expectancy in the Philippines might be lower than the Western Countries therefore less cancer development less deaths due to cancer.|@mbwolverton lol I was just gonna say mortality rates in the Philippines are higher so cancer would make up less of the pie when you divide it up more. Also I think people in the U.K. live longer and are thus more likely to develop diseases like cancer. I like your answer too. So articulate as always.|I'd say mortality rates are higher in the Philippines so that cancer would only make up a small number of the deaths because certain cancers take years to develop fully. Whereas in the UK there is a lower mortality rate so cancers can develop and so they are more statically likely. However there is more than likely other factors that would also influence this....|Like many other countries( almost all) in thePhilippines there is a huge inequality on income distribution. Most of the population is poor and therefore have lesser quality of life. Cause of death differ among social class. It is common that those who are in the high ends acquire cancer more than those in lower ends thus affecting the ratio of cancer deaths. Then there is this factor depending on your economic status you also differ in cancer that you acquire. One is familiar with stomach cancer as the cancer of the wealthy and for example lung cancer as the cancer of poor people.|And UK is a rich country and therefore incidents of cancer death is higher compared to Philippines|@kylesimmons22 I liked this question but not the math one they posted. Bring on the history and literature!!|@tisyanazwa jawab laa we :v|This phenomenon for that may have produced many problems environmental pollution complications of making foods urbanisation of places etc... but a lot of reason why that comes how describe ?|Tuh coba jawab @sasfia|Food|Well  in my opinion the food product is the factor. What I mean here is in UK food that sell by the seller is junk food. Meanwhile in Philippines not same as. So type of food is the most factor to make people die by cancer|The food in the U.K. Is processed more than the Philippines most people may have a healthier homemade diet whereas in the U.K. People may be eating more processed food which may lead to cancer.|Hahaha ciao @iizznajwan|@szwydky discuss?|@isabelsummers_|The U.K. Is also very modernized with many factories leading to toxic or harmful gasses in the Philippines many people still farm. This could be another factor as well.|@ffion_jenks|Various economic and sociopolitical factors can be considered. Although some may turn to diet as a main cause the Philippines also has one of the highest cholesterol rates. Soy product is not a significant part of the diet and some argue that soy is a leading cause of cancer among women. Evidential links between GMO foods and cancer are still being studied. Pollution in concentrated areas like Manila may be considered but not necessarily other areas were pollution is less rampant. Stress in lifestyle paired with a general societal immune system may also contribute to cancer susceptibility. The question of how the causes of cancer may be ""culturally site-specific"" is one that points toward how disease is considered theorized and treated in different parts of the world.|@__.ekta.__ 👀👀|The people of the Philippines are exposed to entirely different factors/variables than the people of the U.K. are.|🤔@joshcowling11|age of death would be my bet|Diet exercise (more people have cars in the UK versus in the Philippines) and pollution (more technologies in UK means more pollution)|High population. Ratio of deaths by cancer decreases.|So what are you trying to say|Fruits/vegetables rice|Because in UK life expectancy is almost 13 years higher and ultimately everybody gets cancer when they are old enough|@oxford_uni I think it's the lifestyle People in Asia esp in Philipines have access in fresh foods like fish (not frozen) and we are known as being happy people despite all the hurricane every year we like going out and having fun. And probably the weather we're in Paradise.|I think it is lifestyle and diet. some time we can say it can found from affluence or poverty in the country.|I think it is all about more physical work and traditional food. Our organism like more the water from our birthplace yes i know it's a little wierd claim but that can maybe be found in our genetic code. And for the end just more work and traditional food and local water.|The population difference and the air|The Philippines is a third world country with living conditions dependent upon the land and no modern precursors. There is no need for cars as they walk preservatives as food is all freshly caught less stress as globalization is dampened in a less modern nation and an islander culture predicated upon a happy go lucky mindset.|@oxford_uni  main factor is the food were not into sausages and processed foods which is the main cause of cancer|@victoresque what's your answer|Aging population in the UK and evidence to show increased risk of cancer with age|Depends. Could be genetics environment (including food) health care system more irradiation etc|@88bb8b8 they take less pills and eat less processed foods lol|More diseases harmless in UK due to tech. Also general health conditions better in uk and people live lpnger leaving cancer as the one thing that'll kill them off.|In the Philippines it is poorertherefore the eat simple less processed foods. They therefore have less chance of getting cancer|I think it is totally about mental i mean for instance little happiness is enough for the people in phillipines or like countries but it is not enough for improved countries. Thus people is getting greedy and it causes more technological enviromental and also mental pullotion for the human physiology psychology etc. Thus it affect this systems causes more percentage for the cancer.|The factors of cancer are much more discernible in the UK than the Phillipines. One of them being the unhealthy lifestyle that we have. Another factor is the pollution that we intake. There are many more vehicles in the UK than the Phillipines. These are both significant and common factors for cancer and seem to be more likely in the UK. @oxford_uni #Medicine|Smoking and unhealthy living. The Philippines is warmer people usually are outside more. In the UK I've heard it rains lots people might be inside more and not getting enough exercise. Also the type of foods they eat are different and some might cause cancer.|Surely this could just be because Filipinos die from lots of other diseases rather than just cancer?|I think its becouse of life expectancy and population the population of philippines is doubled of england population|Thanks for posting a medicine question! Well there may be many factors that affects those stats. But to my best knowledge  cancer is a long term illness people may be more likely to die from another disease other than cancer in the Philippines. I don't know actual figures but I think that UK is more medically advanced so that they are able to treat diseases easily which in contrast hospitals in the Philippines may struggle to treat. This makes something like cancer a more significant factor here in the UK than Philippines. More people dying from another factor may mean less people dying from cancer?|Another factor could just be that people from the UK are more exposed to carcinogens in their lifestyle than people in the Philippines.|No clue waiting for a Literature question :P|@ajaguparov agree 😊😁|@big_sacred_city hey))|😊🎓|@13sscott @livpryer #sociology|They also have a life expectancy of 68 years and infant mortality of 21.4 deaths/1000 live births.

This statistics is more likely to be related to better healthcare system in the UK. First life expectancy there is longer than in the Philippines eldery is a larger layer and they are more likely to get the desease AND die from it. Second in the Philippines more cases may be undeclared/unidentified. Third there may be many more other causes of death related to worse healtcare like if there are 100 dead patients in Philipines and 10 of them are of cancer there may be 20 deaths in the UK for the same period of time and 4 of them are caused by cancer. The statistics is still 1/4 and 1/10 though the real figures are 4 and 10|Even though the U.K. Is relatively more advanced in technology and research than the Philippines they are more exposed to circumstances that might cause cancer than any other disease. Unlike Philippines their major issue maybe battling with HIV or other air and water borne diseases.|@molly_kaye 😚|Undocumented cases of cancer.|Maybe in the Philippines most cancers ho undetected|Maybe in the Philippines the food air and water quality are better|More your speed @beejawhangeerie|Most cancers may be undetected.|Their diet is vastly different than that of the U.K.|In Philippines more people die from many other diseases that can be treated in UK|There is more air pollution in the U.K.|Less biologically modified food|@dimple_o|Intense wifi-cellphone waves?

The Philippines is in stage 3 of the epidemiological transition model whereas the UK is in stage 4.|There are several possible explanations. First people could be dying of something else before they can get cancer – getting shot by a death squad for example. Casual death certification means that causes of death are not reliably recorded and there may also be a cultural reluctance to acknowledge cancer on death certificates. Better genes and better environment could also play a role. In particular more exercise lower obesity rates better diet less alcohol and less smoking all cut cancer risk. And more praying might help too|Carcinogen factors in Philippines maybe they have less factors that affect them instead of UK.|@oxford_uni  maybe the diet they have in philippines the way the food is procces in the uk may be harmful. The contaminated air the way people live in the uk levels of depression anxiety that causes people to drink to smoke or even get cancer. Diet on the uk level of obesity in uk. So for me those are the main factors. Maybe people in  philippines have a more calmed and relax life.|Our food is more modified than them we have a different lifestyle and diet and we produce more toxic gasses? Maybe one or more of these could have an impact on the statistics??|People in the Philippines may lead less sedentary lifestyles and eat less processed foods than people in the U.K.|Or.... they die from other diseases that can be treated in the UK!|The genetic of the people could be also the answer maybe they have more evolve dna.|The difference of the number of population underdiagnosed and/or undocumented cases in phillipines|@wannurafizi probably they cancers death weren't recorded as systematically as the US|@wannurafizi i mean the UK #HailTrump|Undocumented cases and environmental differences|Uk la pundek. Or probably the wide use of legit herbal ingredients in their food compared to the Uk @iizznajwan|@oxford_uni  it may not be a question of diet or genetic factors it could simply be that more people die un-natural deaths in the Philippines possibly due to a lack of healthcare which would cause people to die from illnesses that would be curable here in the UK. Therefore because of the higher amount of un-natural deaths the proportion of people who die from cancer would be smaller.|@wannurafizi nah that factor would be to small to be a factor i guess .

Interviewer: Rebecca Cotton-Barratt Christ Church

Q: Imagine a ladder leaning against a vertical wall with its feet on the ground. The middle rung of the ladder has been painted a different colour on the side so that we can see it when we look at the ladder from the side on. What shape does that middle rung trace out as the ladder falls to the floor?

Rebecca: This question tests whether you can do what mathematicians do which is to abstract away all the unimportant information and use mathematics to represent what’s going on. I'd initially ask the candidate what shape they think will be formed and then ask them how they can test this hypothesis. They might initially try sketching the ladder at different stages – this is fine but ultimately what we want is something that we can generalise and that is accurate (you can't be sure that your drawing is that accurate particularly when you're making a sketch on a whiteboard and don't have a ruler). So eventually they will fall back on maths and try to model the situation using equations. If they get stuck we would ask them what shape the ladder makes with the wall and floor and they'll eventually spot that at each stage the ladder is forming a right-angled triangle. Some might then immediately leap to Pythagoras' Theorem and use that to find the answer (which is that it forms a quarter circle centred on the point where the floor meets the wall). This is a fun question because the answer is typically the opposite of what they expect because they think about the shape the ladder makes when it falls (which is a series of tangents to a curve centred away from the wall and the floor). A nice extension is what happens when we look at a point 1/3 or 2/3 up the ladder.

In Africa 470000 babies die each year on the day they are born and 1 in 10 children do not reach their 5th birthday. That needs changing but emergency care training is very expensive and if you are from a remote area the training centres might be too far away anyway.
Which is where gaming comes in! Oxford scientists are developing a radical new immersive virtual-reality game that will teach healthcare workers wherever they are first how to save the life of a newborn baby in distress and subsequently how to handle many types of emergencies.
The game which combines cutting edge medical research with the latest in virtual reality gaming tech is called LIFE and is being developed in Kenya where gamers will be trained so that their first instinct in an emergency is to act correctly.
To make the training tool even more effective it is also available as a mobile game so that Kenyans right across the country have access to it!

Originally developed to help Oxford researchers study ancient Egyptian papyri the uses of this scanner have proved to go far beyond that.
Combining six different light wavelengths from Infra Red to Ultra Violet this simple-looking A4 device can analyse any document in numerous ways that the human eye would never be capable of.
From differences in paper and ink to detection of alteration the portable scanner is able to compare any manuscript to a vast database and uncover in just a few minutes whether something is real or fake.
So whether it is detecting art forgery exposing voter fraud or utilising facial recognition on a passport photo the Oxford scanner looks set to fundamentally change the way that documents are studied verified and understood.
What’s more in the future the technology is likely to find its way onto smartphones and security systems meaning we could process multi-spectral images on the go with the former and identify people no matter how much makeup or prosthetics they have on with the latter – bad news for Eddie Murphy films!

Researchers at Oxford Nanopore have created a revolutionary new technology that makes sequencing possible on-the-go with a device smaller than a mobile phone anywhere in the world – and maybe even beyond!

The MinION passes an ionic current through tiny holes called nanopores. As DNA passes through these holes tracking the changes in the current can then allow scientists to identify the DNA sequence.

The world’s first portable device for the analysis of biological molecules MinION just arrived at the International Space Station where NASA astronaut Kate Rubins will perform the first DNA sequencing in microgravity.

Down on earth researchers have been tracking Zika in Brazil Ebola in Guinea monitoring lakes in Australia plants on mountains and even recognising signs that bacteria are resistant to antibiotics.

668,,,"Could one paper-thin material really serve as heat-controlling window glazing as well as being the future of lightweight power-saving high-resolution screens?

Oxford scientists at Bodle have pioneered just that – a smart material that is flexible thin and transparent. Layers of this material could be used as futuristic glazing able to control which wavelengths of light enter a building. That would cut down on energy costs as spaces could be cooled effectively without the need for aircon.

Or it could replace pixels by being used as bright and hi-tech displays – which could be viewed effortlessly even in bright sunlight. What’s more Bodle promises a revolution in battery-life. Your current smart-phone might struggle to make it through the day but screens made with this smart material would use almost no power at all meaning your phone would manage a week at least.

The technology could even be used to create unfakeable holograms that could put a stop to counterfeiting!

Oxford researchers have developed a revolutionary 3D motion capture system that measures and maps the running styles and patterns of individual athletes and tells them what to change and how to improve their performance.

Run3D uses multiple state-of-the-art cameras to capture every aspect of a runner’s posture. Infrared cameras are trained on tiny reflective markers stuck onto the subject creating a computational model of the body in motion and providing detail right down to how individual bones and joints are impacted as the body moves. 
The same motion-capture technology is used in films and games but here it could help to create the complete athlete. Complicated algorithms based on a database of runners can work out the perfect running stance.

Now you’ve got no excuse not to go for a jog!

All medicines must be tested in the lab before they are given to humans in case they are toxic. Animal testing has been the main way scientists can find out if drugs are likely to be safe but thanks to this breakthrough there may be no more need for it!

What’s more animals often do not respond to drugs in the same way as humans anyway so these tiny organs will give far clearer results than animals ever could.

But CEO Dr Emma Sceats isn't going to stop there. CN Bio are working with international researchers in a race to develop a whole human body on a chip with all the internal organs represented by little devices just like this one which would completely change the way drugs are developed and tested and make vital medicines much much cheaper.

672,,,"How can one small bottle of liquid power four homes for a year?

Oxford scientists have been developing a solar device using something called perovskites which can boost the performance of existing solar panel technologies.

Perovskites are used to create a low-cost highly efficient solar cell absorber material that converts sunlight into electricity because they can be tuned to capture wavelengths of light that traditional solar panels can’t.  This layer can be almost completely transparent and can even be employed in windows.

Every hour enough light falls on the earth to power the planet for a year yet today less than 1% of global electricity is generated from solar power.

Oxford PV are out to change that and their perovskite devices can even be used on houses and glass-clad high-rise buildings to transform the ways in which solar energy is harnessed and allow solar energy to contribute a much higher proportion of electricity than is possible today.

So one day all our windows might also act as solar panels – the future certainly looks bright!

“I had a lot of ideas of what I thought Oxford would be like and what the people would be like and honestly as soon as I got here I realised none of it was true at all. My advice would be if you’re really passionate about your subject and you can find a course that suits you then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t apply to Oxford. It doesn’t discriminate based on where you’re from.” #GoingtoOxford #OxfordUniversity",humansofoxford alevelresults goingtooxford oxforduniversity,|Sweet...|Mirip tara @nadyajessica|Wanna be !|@minaal_p we should do something like this.

""I've picked a copper-alloy statuette of the Egyptian deities Isis and Harpocrates—one of the dozen or so unpublished ancient Egyptian objects in the Harris Manchester College archive which I worked on during the Easter vacation. They've led me down a rabbit-hole of sorts—I've had to track questions of origin typology and acquisition history through books catalogues 19th-century letters even perfume bottle labels! As an Egyptology student here this small 2000-year old statuette encapsulates for me the amazing academic resources Oxford holds and the little gems that often lie hidden right beneath our noses.""

715,,,"We asked you to share a photo of you with your #OxfordObject - an object that captures the Oxford experience for you. Here's one from @_ellenbrewster
~
The object I have chosen is my copy of James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. I was given it when I was 17 when I took part in the Oxford UNIQ Summer School (""A gift from the Oxford University Press""). Since then I have used the book during my undergraduate degree writing about it in both my first year exams and my final year dissertation. To me the book acts as a reminder of how far my understanding of literature in English has come: it contains my annotations from when I was 17 which make me wince as they show how much I initially struggled with reading the book! But because of that the book is now a personal record of how my thinking has changed as a result of my time at university so I don't regret writing in it.

""I've chosen carnations which have a special meaning for anyone at this university. When you sit exams as an Oxford student it's tradition for someone to buy you carnations in three different colours: white pink and red. 
You wear the white carnation pinned to your gown for your first exam pink for the ones in between and red for your very last exam. So at a glance people can tell you're about to be done and congratulate you!
For me this sums up Oxford because it's an adorable tradition supported by community spirit - it's a mark of friendship to buy someone their carnations and almost a rite of passage to wear them!""

766,,,"I've just finished my psychology DPhil here at Oxford and in my spare time I love to dance. I am curious about why humans might have started making music and dancing in the first place and whether there might have been adaptive advantages to doing so. In my DPhil I looked at some of the neurological and psychological mechanisms at play when we dance with others. I found that we're probably not all that different from our ancient ancestors; for them as for us dance acts as a potent 'social glue.' Still today I think people would do well to dance and make music more!

Universities showing their support for the LGBTQ community is another step towards equality and hopefully ending this discrimination and bullying that gay people face.|@nurdianto_1 of course I accept members of my family that are LGBTQ like I accept my friends that are and - oh yeah - myself. Just because you are so small minded that you can't accept LGBTQ people in your own family doesn't mean the rest of us can't either.|You can support LGBTQ rights at the same time you support women and migrants rights. You don't have to choose one if you're a smart person. Look around you. Gay people do exist even if you think it's immoral. You only need to be respectful.|@ignacebm nobody is arguing that LGBTQ rights stand above any others. Furthermore you have completely misunderstood what the flag stands for. Discrimination is morally wrong and quite obviously you are homophobic and advocate descrimination against gay people. So please for the sake of everyone keep your hate speech to yourself|My Future University|@andreacristina182 I agree with you and I think that LGBT minorities need support just as all other minorities. Their discrimination is real unfortunately. I have LGBT friends and their rights are important. I am a liberal. However I do not see institutionalised public support for the rights of migrants. Hate speech against them is real and they experience discrimination every day. I think that there should be more attention to this topic. The problem is that this topic is unpopular and public opinion is divided. OxUni should take courage to stand for the rights of migrants/refugees just as it stands for the LGBT rights.|Astagfirullah:( just realized suddenly|@prestongouldslays Still nothing of substantial logical coherence in favor of gay ethics|@prestongouldslays That thought experiment is faulty consider there are pedophiles out there who claim authority and freedom to sleep with kids my question would then be does that suffice as a reason not to act under imperative moral commands (regardless the plethora of post-modern views on morality) against it just because ""who people sleep with is none of your business""? If so then you're messed up...|@ignacebm that quite literally doesn't make sense? You are essentially stating that their is no coherence in the desire to abolish discrimination and yet you are against discrimination in matters that are of importance to you? Your hypocrisy is shocking your belligerence appalling and your obduracy laughable|@gnarlymasonokay|Read comments above. @mwilliams.11|😂 @georgeshaw37|Poor @ignacebm. I feel really bad for you for being so ignorant. While the majority of your comments are in poor taste I'll focus on the good this image portrays. You stated to @jessiee1995 that we would never be subjected to terrible discrimination in Oxford because it is an elite university and we live in one of the richest countries in the world. That's just inaccurate (as @jessiee1995 pointed out). Comments stereotypes discrimination and violence towards the LGBT community happen every day everywhere. In addition the university has taken a stand to promote equality and acceptance for all LGBT individuals and their rights. Being a powerful university with a huge global impact their message to the world is huge. Furthermore their message resonates to the students and staff who come from around the world. How do you think this feels to someone who has had to hide their entire life because of their sexuality in fear that they might be killed because of the illegality of being LGBT in their country? I'm sure you'll come back with some snarky remark and likely attack me as an individual for being a gay man but I hope you'll take a second to think about the fact that discrimination isn't acceptable under any circumstances. We are all human beings so start accepting that people are different and show some respect.|@adamowski87 .|@aliakbarf|@adamowski87 jestes polakiem?|@oh_my_b0nes|Фу|@mirrrrela гейййй|@amyclairebush just seen a load of these pics they're so sick|@nikoupic follow this page☺️🙏🏼|@tantiputrii",3583
