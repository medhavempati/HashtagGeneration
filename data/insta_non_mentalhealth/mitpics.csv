2,,,"Congratulations to MIT’s Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo have won the Nobel Prize in economics “for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty."" They share the prize with Michael Kremer of Harvard.

Reposted from @nobelprize_org (@get_regrann) 
The research conducted by this year’s Laureates has considerably improved our ability to fight global poverty. In just two decades their new experiment-based approach has transformed development economics which is now a flourishing field of research. 
Despite recent dramatic improvements one of humanity’s most urgent issues is the reduction of global poverty in all its forms. More than 700 million people still subsist on extremely low incomes. Every year around five million children under the age of five still die of diseases that could often have been prevented or cured with inexpensive treatments. Half of the world’s children still leave school without basic literacy and numeracy skills. 
This year’s Laureates have introduced a new approach to obtaining reliable answers about the best ways to fight global poverty. In brief it involves dividing this issue into smaller more manageable questions – for example the most effective interventions for improving educational outcomes or child health. They have shown that these smaller more precise questions are often best answered via carefully designed experiments among the people who are most affected. 
The 2019 Economic Sciences Laureates have played a decisive role in reshaping research in development economics. Over just 20 years the subject has become a flourishing primarily experimental area of mainstream economics. This new experiment-based research has already helped in alleviating global poverty and has great potential to further improve the lives of the most impoverished people on the planet.

Q: What’s your favorite museum?
A: The Sir John Soane Museum in London. Basically the items in this museum were collected by this person on his travels around Europe. He also designed his house in a fun way. My favorite room in the house is the breakfast room. Because it’s a small London townhouse he only has so many windows. He has this room designed so it has beautifully painted columns with mosaics and mirrors so that the light from far away windows gets reflected everywhere and creates a golden hue in the room.

Q: What is your secret talent?
A: I can sketch!

Q: What did you want to be when you were a kid?
A: A paleontologist. I love dinosaurs. Or a spy or detective. I used to make DIY spy gear.

Q: What is your favorite food?
A: Mofongo which is made out of plantains with red snapper.

Q: If you could travel anywhere right now where would you go?
A: My first answer would be to go back to Puerto Rico for my family friends and the beautiful beaches. If not there I’d like to travel to Latin America because there’s such a rich history there.

Q: Do you get homesick?
A: Definitely. That’s why I always try to travel within the restrictions of the job back home. I go back twice a year at least but at least during Christmastime. Christmas in Puerto Rico is the most fun so I always go back for at least two weeks.

A key contributor to this effort was Margaret Hamilton (above left) who led the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory now the independent Draper Laboratory which contracted with NASA to produce Apollo's guidance system. But Hamilton was just one of a number of women working at the Instrumentation Laboratory at the time. Others included Jayne Partridge who was responsible for developing the semiconductor parts used in the Apollo Guidance Computer; Madeline Sullivan (second from left) who programmed dynamics and control systems and connected guidance and navigation hardware; Elaine Denniston (second from right) who keypunched data written by staff programmers and Saydean Zelin (right) who designed software that allowed astronauts to control Apollo's engines. #Apollo50th

Q: Do you like nature?
A: I do. I have a lot of travel coming up with conferences and stuff. I’m definitely excited about that but I’m also taking a weekend to go camping with my friends in the White Mountains. That will be nice to disconnect for a couple of days go hiking and enjoy nature away from the city. That’s one thing I really like about Boston. It’s a nice city there are a lot of things to do but then you can drive a couple of hours and you can be at nice beaches or the middle of the mountains and get away from it all.

Q: What’s something people don’t really know about you?
A: I can juggle. It took me a while to learn. One summer I just practiced with a friend who knew how and finally figured it out. I now believe that anyone can learn how to juggle. You think ‘no I can’t I’m not coordinated enough’ but you can. Anyone can learn how to juggle.

Q: What’s one thing you miss from home that you wish were here?
A: This might be cheating but I have to go with my sister and my niece. If they could be here that would be amazing. I FaceTime them multiple times a day. I always feel so guilty that I can’t be around all the time so I would move them here with me. And I guess my brother-in-law should come. 🙂

See link in bio for the MIT news article on Clare: http://mitsha.re/ZYOB50uE4QS  #ThisisMIT

Q: What is one thing that surprised you about MIT before coming here?
A: What surprised me about MIT or rather the connection that I never made clearly until coming here was that MIT was founded right at the start of the Civil War.

Q: What is your secret talent?
A: I have a first-degree black belt in taekwondo. I practice on my own. I used to compete in college. I was practicing with a group all the way up until three years ago.

Q: What is your favorite movie?
A: One of my favorite films is Before Sunset. It’s part of the [Before] trilogy. I don’t like the first film because I think it’s too cheesy. The third film is too depressing. The second film I like.

Q: What food did you eat more than once this week? What’s the reason?
A: Dal because it's impossible to prepare a single portion of dal and because it's delicious.

Q: Name something you did not know about MIT until you got here?
A: I did not realize ""Pi"" in English sounds like ""pie"" until my first Pi Day at MIT. I was puzzled the whole day trying to understand why MIT people were carving greek letters on their desserts all around campus.

Q: What would 5-year-old you say to you today?
A: Stop whatever you are doing and go finish the new Zelda.

Q: Who do you think should play you in a movie?
A: Denzel Washington … young Denzel.

Q: What’s one item that you brought from home to college that has no practical use and why did you bring it?
A: At the end of the football season in high school we got these little football helmets that are very small-scale versions of our actual football helmets. I took mine with me to remind me of my experience in football which was a very impactful experience for me. It just sits at my bedside. It’s been there since freshman year.

Q: What would 5-year-old you say to you today?
A: Can I get a honeybun? The one with the white glaze.

Q: Since you work in finance do you have a favorite stock?
A: Stocks are overrated. Mortgages are where it’s at.

Q: If you had a superpower what would it be?
A: If I had a superpower I would really like to have Spiderman’s powers — to be able to scale walls and stuff.

Q: If you could build like any robot what would it be?
A: I would have a robot that could do my laundry from beginning to end. I come back to my room everything’s clean already in my cabinet just done. Folded on the hangers done.

After the turn of the century Howe established the first all-female architecture practice in Boston — and the second in the United States — eventually recruiting two MIT alumnae Eleanor Manning (Class of 1906) and Mary Almy (Class of 1920) as partners.

By the time of Howe's retirement in 1937 her firm had completed 426 commissions mostly renovations and other single-family projects.

Q: What musician should play you in a movie living or dead?
A: Well my middle name is Wolfgang so I would have to say Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Plus as a flutist I would love the irony of having Mozart play me since he is supposed to have had a severe dislike for the flute.

Q: Was MIT what you expected before you started and why? Or why not?
A: In some ways yes and some ways no. I guess I kind of expected that the stereotypes of nerds would be true and it is in some ways — but they’re not exactly nerdy in the way that might be portrayed in a movie. They’re nerdy in the sense that they’re very passionate about what they do. It’s actually an amazing community of people to be a part of.

The other thing is the quality of music here. I kind of expected ‘well it’s a technology school I don’t know if they’re going to care about music that much.’ And yet the music faculty has just been absolutely amazing. I’ve had so many more experiences in music than I would have thought possible. During my first year it felt like I was basically a part-time musician because I was a part of so many cool musical experiences.

Q: What is something every MIT student should experience while they’re here?
A: I would say doing research at some point. I feel like I learned a lot more from working on a real-world project than just learning through classes. By doing research you get to fill in all the details that you didn’t realize you didn’t fully understand in class. And you get to have a real impact which I think is amazing.

And we share it with other clubs but DT starting last year kind of just took it over. Sometimes people just nap cause there’s a couch in there and it’s quiet. But especially last year a bunch of us would just run into each other in there at absurd times.

Q: What would five-year-old you say to you today?
A: I feel like I’d ask if I was still having fun. And then I’d ask ‘Do you still swim and play soccer?’ Honestly she wouldn’t really say much because she was really shy. Five-year-old me was scared of people especially older especially teenage people.

176,,,"When senior Julia Ginder isn’t investigating the mystery of her own allergies she’s volunteering to help young people reach their goals. #ThisisMIT

Q: Who do you think should play you in a movie?
A: I would love Emma Watson to play me in a movie. She’s amazing. First of all she played Hermione Granger who was my favorite character growing up. She’s also someone I look up to for how she stands up for her beliefs and makes an impact outside of acting.

Q: What is your favorite dining hall?
A: I liked Maseeh Dining because it had a lot of options which was good for my allergies. They had the kosher station which was crucial for me.

Q: What food did you eat more than once this week?
A: A peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It’s what I had in the fridge.

Q: Choose two words to describe MIT and why.
A: Challenging and diverse.
Challenging: I really like to put myself in situations where I might not be comfortable and MIT sounded about as challenging as I could get for college. It’s a place where your professors expect a lot of you in the classroom and you are expected to dedicate a lot to any organization to which you commit. In this environment I have learned about the dedication and focus it takes to succeed which I think is exciting.

Diversity: That’s important to me on a few different levels. There are so many different people at MIT with varied interests and backgrounds. Coming from Maine I made a conscious decision to come to MIT instead of staying where I was.

I also don’t think I realized how many different technology degrees there could be! Although people have a variety of technical interests you learn quickly that no two Course 6 majors have the same passions. All those secondary interests people have make it exciting to talk to people from all over MIT because you will probably learn about a new lab or program that’s offered.

Q: Who do you think should play you in a movie and why?
A: I would love to be played by Thor [Chris Hemsworth] in a movie.

Q: Choose three words to describe MIT. And why you chose them.
A: Can I just use a phrase? MIT is as hard as you choose it to be. In trying to learn so much things become hard. I chose to row I don’t have to row it would probably make my semester so much easier not to. Or the particular classes I’m taking. I could drop one and still graduate. So it’s more a I guess a self-imposed sort of goal.

Q: What is your favorite movie?
A: My favorite movie is Kung Fu Panda 2. It just took a place in my heart for some unknown reason.

Q: What item did you bring to college from home that has no practical use and why?
A: I would say this necklace that I’m wearing right now. I brought it from home because it reminds me of my mom who gave it to me. It’s like she’s always here. So it reminds me of where I came from.

Q: How would you describe MIT’s student culture?
A: It’s unique and diverse. Different areas different clubs different dorms — they all have their own cultures. There’s a lot of different types of people that you find here for sure.

Q: What would you send to outer space and why?

Q: Who do you think should play you in a movie and why?
A: Will Ferrell went to my high school. My hair’s short right now but when my hair gets longer it kind of curls up like his and gets all puffy and I think he’s really funny. So I would like Will Ferrell.

Q: What’s a superpower you’d like to have?
A: I’d like to be able to teleport. That sounds really fun. Obviously to walk through walls the classic ones that would be fun.

Q: What is something every MIT student should experience while they’re here?
A: I think getting to know a faculty member very well.

Learn more from MIT News: http://mitsha.re/h3ux30m8WFd

BREAKING NEWS: The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2018 to William D. Nordhaus “for integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis” and Paul M. Romer “for integrating technological innovations into long-run macroeconomic analysis.” Nordhaus and Romer have designed methods for addressing some of our time’s most basic and pressing questions about how we create long-term sustained and sustainable economic growth. 
At its heart economics deals with the management of scarce resources. Nature dictates the main constraints on economic growth and our knowledge determines how well we deal with these constraints. This year’s laureates Nordhaus and Romer have significantly broadened the scope of economic analysis by constructing models that explain how the market economy interacts with nature and knowledge. 
Romer’s and Nordhaus’ contributions are crucial steps forward in addressing central questions about the future of humanity. We do not yet have conclusive answers to these questions but the laureates’ methods have been fundamental in allowing current and future researchers to improve our understanding of the best way to progress towards sustained and sustainable global economic growth.

I'm not as concerned about the effects this will have in our environment(while I don't doubt that it will have one and am definitely concerned about environmental effects)this also has damaged our foreign relations. If the US specifically the White House continues to pursue an isolationist policy in terms of foreign relations we will loose out on the global economy and we cannot function without participating in the global economy. We will also continue to loose respect among other countries and will loose our place as the leader of the free world if that hasn't already happened. We have to work together with other nations to achieve our goals. As a side note: the Paris agreement is not meant to benefit a single country or group of allies it is intended to safeguard everyone living on this planet and everyone who will be. Speak up about your feelings on the issue and let the world know that our leaders actions do not fully reflect their people's beliefs. Tell the leaders what their people want.

BREAKING NEWS: The Prize in Economic Sciences 2016 is awarded to

Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmström “for their contributions to contract theory”

What is Contract theory?
Contract theory provides us with a general means of understanding contract design. One of the theory’s goals is to explain why contracts have various forms and designs. Another goal is to help us work out how to draw up better contracts thereby shaping better institutions in society. Should providers of public services such as schools hospitals or prisons be publicly or privately owned? Should teachers healthcare workers and prison guards be paid fixed salaries or should their pay be performance-based? To what extent should managers be paid through bonus programmes or stock options? 
Contract theory does not necessarily provide definitive or unique answers to these questions. However the power of the theory is that it enables us to think clearly about the issues involved and help us understand the potential pitfalls when designing new contracts. #NobelPrize

1065,,,"Why is there a ""J"" sign on MIT Building 44? -- ""By the end of WWII it was clear that in the future physicists would need access to increasingly larger and more expensive research facilities than any one university could provide. MIT and eight other major eastern universities formed a non-profit corporation to establish a new nuclear science facility. In 1947 under the direction of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Brookhaven National Laboratory opened. The pioneering center has been home to seven Nobel Prize-winning discoveries. In 1974 during high energy particle physics experiments using Brookhaven's Alternating Gradient Synchrotron MIT Professor Samuel C. C. Ting discovered a new kind of heavy elementary particle. Since the last meson was named the K particle Ting named the new one the J particle. Ting won the 1976 Nobel Prize for this discovery and gave his acceptance speech in Chinese the first Nobel Laureate to do so. The particle was independently and simultaneously discovered by a team at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center whose leader MIT alumnus Burton Richter shared the prize with Ting. There were Js everywhere after the announcement of Ting's Nobel Prize including this sign which has remained above the entrance to the MIT Cyclotron on Vassar Street for 35 years. The sign is on loan from the MIT Department of Physics."" - From the MIT 150 Exhibition label for the J particle sign (http://mitsha.re/jparticle) #massachusettsinstituteoftechnology #physics #mit #onlyatmit #jparticle #cyclotron #mitcampus",massachusettsinstituteoftechno physics mit onlyatmit jparticle cyclotron mitcampus,"|Really great typography, too!",134

It is part of MIT’s public art collection which in 2006 was named one of the top 10 public art collections in the United States. Calder made this sculpture in France. As explained by the MIT Museum ""the 33-ton sculpture was disassembled shipped to Cambridge and installed at MIT in 1966. Its five intersecting curved steel forms rise 40 feet yet barely touch the ground creating a playful tension between the massive structure and lightness of its footprint. The sculptor trained as a mechanical engineer before pursuing a career in art and his interest in giving expression to the dynamic interplay between art and engineering appealed to the MIT community."" Did you know: Calder created a model for testing in MIT’s Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel to determine what the wind load would be on the finished work. Also a time capsule is buried beneath it. ""During installation of the sculpture in 1966 professors Harold Edgerton and Robert Schrock supervised the burial of a time capsule under it."" @MITmuseum @mitlistarts #sculpture #beauty #alexandercalder #publicart #mit #mitcampus #seenatMIT #onlyatMIT",engineering art sculpture beauty alexandercalder publicart mit mitcampus seenatmit onlyatmit,|Don't forget #mitlist!
