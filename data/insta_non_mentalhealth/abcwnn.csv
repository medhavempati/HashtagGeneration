It is clear to me after watching Maggie Rulli substitute for Diane that Maggie provides a much fresher approach and has great chemistry with Kendis.  However that being said I also think that Stephanie Ramos was also excellent when she was there.  Diane today looked tired.|🤣🤣|Yea! 😎|So glad to see you back Diane !!|Is how the shark just finned @kendisgibson hahahaha|Yes beautiful morning|I love some Jack!! He’s so funny|YEAH!

They are the best together!!!! 🤞|@kendisgibson  I literally fell off my chair laughing when I saw your feet I'm weak hahahaha|@abcwnn; While I appreciate that Diane decided to have another baby, let's face it,  describing a pregnant woman as glowing is a stretch, literally and figuratively.  Diane has clearly taken the phrase ""eating for two"", literally.  Next thing, she will be seen wearing skin tight dresses that show the shape of her belly button, unlike the more conservative ways of old, where women would actually wear maternity dresses!  I don't understand why women today actually think they look good wearing tight dresses when they are pregnant?  I mean, c'mon now!  And hey, I actually have liked Diane from the start, but I have to admit that her constantly sucking in her lips, singing, dancing, are all getting somewhat old.  But as an objective fan, it is clear that Maggie Rulli has the same, if not better, chemistry with the now legendary Kendis Gibson, without the annoyances of Diane.  As I said, this is a good time for Diane to concentrate on motherhood...",126

These people who think what Kendis did was gross should learn about the facts of life!  It is WELL KNOWN about foot fetish and how a woman's foot is one of her most sensitive erogenous zones.  That is why high heels are so precious to women as they offer a way to show off their feet.  Now with open toe shoes being the rage it is also why men MUCH prefer to see women wearing high heel shoes.  Believe me the only thing about Kendis's drinking from her shoe that shocked me was why he didn't ""lick"" the inside of the shoe first before he poured the water into it and then drank!  So to those people who thought it was gross instead I offer the thought that instead of being gross that on the contrary it was probably the ""hottest"" thing I have seen on tv especially on network news!

The above is a news clip I stumbled upon. I find it downrite disgusting how this reporter attacked the character of a 17 year old child insinuating she is a whore and won't be coming home from prom. Her statement even appeared to catch her cohost off guard. This is a young lady that chose to represent the Black Lives Matter movement by wearing a dress displaying the faces of those killed by police and through other tragedies. I can personally say I don't like the dress however I applaud this child's message and courage to wear such a statement. This reporter took it upon herself to publicly insult this child and to make assumptions about her character instead of being able to focus on the message being conveyed. I seriously think this clip should be reviewed and this reporter spoken to about her hurtful insulting and judgmental thoughts about this innocent child. This has indeed hurt and upset many people. This is unacceptable nor will it be tolerated. I thank you for your time.|The link:  https://www.facebook.com/fefe.wms.1/posts/10206734782608798|🌍🌟|I love me some diana",450

🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 What we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will give us later.
–Romans 8:18 (TLB)

Nowhere does the Bible teach that Christians are to be exempt from the tribulations and natural disasters that come upon the world. It does teach that the Christian can face tribulation crisis calamity and personal suffering with a supernatural power that is not available to the person outside Christ. The early Christians were able to experience joy in their hearts in the midst of trials troubles and depression. They counted suffering for Christ not as a burden or misfortune but as a great honor as evidence that Christ counted them worthy to witness to Him through suffering. They never forgot what Christ Himself had gone through for their salvation; and to suffer for His name's sake was regarded as a gift rather than a cross. Christians can rejoice in tribulation because they have eternity's values in view. When the pressures are on they look beyond their present predicaments to the glories of heaven. The thought of the future life with its prerogatives and joys helps to make the trials of the present seem light and transient.

Sometimes you gotta have fun. For the past three weeks there have been four snowmen on display in the Rose Garden (see photo in earlier post).
