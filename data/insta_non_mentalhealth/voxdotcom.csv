1,,,"The Democrats running for president have spent 12 hours 22 minutes and 3 seconds onstage for Democratic primary debates. Across three debates on five nights in June July and September one topic has consistently dominated: health care.

With over 90 minutes of discussion time so far health care leads the next-most-discussed issue immigration by double digits in minutes. It’s gotten twice as much attention as foreign policy an area where the president arguably has far more control to dictate an agenda and eclipses topics such as abortion the opioid epidemic and Trump all of which have scarcely come up in the debates at all.

With tonight’s debate the amount of time spent discussing various issues especially Trump’s recent activities is sure to change.

2,,,"Senate Republicans’ attitudes on impeachment sure have changed a lot since 1999. Back then Republicans were eager to condemn Bill Clinton for his abuse of the presidential office. But 20 years later they’re giving President Donald Trump a lot more breathing room.

There are fourteen current members of the Senate who were serving in Congress during Clinton’s impeachment proceedings — and at least 10 are striking an entirely different tone with their approach to a potential Trump impeachment. Two notable names on that list are: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who indicted Clinton for lying in 1999 but is downplaying today’s scandal involving Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Then there’s Sen. Lindsey Graham who was an outspoken Trump critic but has since turned into an ally in 2019. 
But the GOP in general is sticking very close to Trump. Other prominent Republicans who were involved in the Clinton impeachment like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich have also strongly pushed back against calls for impeachment. The overall Republican response to impeachment highlights an about-face along partisan lines and underscores how politicized a process impeachment is. It’s worth noting that a similar dynamic was present in 1999: Democrats overwhelmingly stood by Clinton.

3,,,"The Amazon rainforest is losing a soccer field-size area every minute. Without enough water to sustain itself the rainforest may degrade into a savanna releasing gobs of carbon into the air. 
We must make major changes to how we manage farmland forests and our own food in order to combat climate change. That’s the conclusion of a sprawling UN report released in August. In a call with reporters ahead of the report’s release Carlos Nobre a senior scientist at the University of São Paulo and a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute Brasil warned that the rapid loss of tropical rainforests is especially concerning given how much carbon these ecosystems store and how quickly they are being lost. “The Amazon may be closer to a tipping point than ever before” he said.

4,,,"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump. It’s important to note that this doesn’t necessarily mean the House will vote on articles of impeachment — but it’s historic nonetheless. This is only the fourth time in US history that a formal impeachment process has been undertaken against a president.

Pelosi’s announcement comes in the wake of a whistleblower complaint that the White House has withheld from Congress amid news reports that President Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the business ties of Joe Biden’s son. “The president must be held accountable” Pelosi said Tuesday during the announcement. “No one is above the law.” Pelosi’s announcement marks a notable shift on the subject of impeachment which is a controversial and ultimately political move. But the furor over Ukraine led to a wave of House Democrats in swing states who had previously opposed impeachments to support an inquiry (25 and counting as of Tuesday afternoon). For many the news drove home a painfully clear reality: an emboldened Donald Trump is again tied to accusations of meddling in a US election right before their eyes

As of Sunday night almost 1150 people had signed up to attend  the protest event called Shut Down DC which was loosely associated with the D.C. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America and Black Lives Matter D.C.
The D.C. protest followed a day of global climate strikes on Friday when an estimated 4 million people in more than 160 countries walked out of schools and workplaces to demand action on climate change.  The Global Climate Strikes inspired by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg may end up being the largest mass protest for action on global warming in history.

6,,,"The #ClimateStrike around the world on Friday proved that 16-year-old Swedish climate activist @gretathunberg isn’t a lone voice but a messenger for a growing social movement.

The largest climate strike in the US happened in New York City. Strikers gathered in Foley Park and marched down Broadway past city hall and then Nassau Street around the Wall Street bull before rallying in Battery Park. Activists estimated more than 300000 people joined the New York City rally and city officials soon had to turn marchers away from the parks.

Many people who heard about the attack on the news or on the street would say that moment was frozen in their memory forever.

But your memories of that moment are probably not as accurate as you think.

According to neuroscientist Elizabeth Phelps ""about 50% of the details of that memory change in a year even though most people are convinced they're 100% right."" There’s more to forming memories than you might expect. They’re influenced strongly by our emotions surroundings and the narrative of the moment we create after the fact.

10,,,"Vice President Mike Pence met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday to discuss potential trade deals ahead of Johnson’s plan to have the United Kingdom leave the European Union on Oct. 31.⁣
⁣
According to a statement from the White House Pence “underscored the United States’ unfailing commitment” to the US-UK Special Relationship offered support for #Brexit and reiterated that the US is committed to forming a comprehensive free trade agreement once the UK’s departure from the EU is finalized.⁣
⁣
“I spoke to President Trump this morning” Pence told Johnson at the meeting. “He said ‘You tell my friend Prime Minister Boris Johnson that we’re ready to go to work on that free trade agreement just as soon as you’re ready.’” ⁣
⁣
While Johnson remains steadfast in his goal of completing Brexit with or without a deal by the end of October it is unclear if that will actually happen. Parliament including some members of Johnson’s own Conservative Party largely oppose a no-deal Brexit. On Tuesday Parliament handed the new prime minister his first legislative defeat by voting to seize control so it could debate a bill that would attempt to prevent Brexit without a plan in place. Johnson threatened elections for a new Parliament in response — and Parliament soundly defeated that measure too.

11,,,"Florida is bracing itself for Hurricane Dorian. The storm has weakened to a Category 2 hurricane since ravaging the Bahamas over the weekend but has grown larger in size. It is expected to affect portions of Florida’s east coast as well as the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas. More than 10 Florida airports have closed in anticipation of the storm and 93 nursing homes and seven hospitals have been evacuated. ⁣
⁣
The National Hurricane Center has warned that the storm still poses a threat: “The combined wind surge and floods hazards are the same or even worse since the hurricane has become larger” the agency said on Twitter.⁣
⁣
#Dorian hit Grand Bahama Island as an incredibly powerful Category 5 hurricane on Sunday night with howling 185 mile-per-hour winds. And then it basically camped on the island subjecting Grand Bahama and the nearby Abaco Islands to 40 hours of some of the most intense hurricane conditions possible from a storm.⁣
⁣
Five people have been reported dead and it’s possible that figure will rise. It is estimated that 13000 homes may have been severely damaged or destroyed across the Bahamas and 61000 of Grand Bahama and Abaco’s 70000 residents will need food assistance.

12,,,"⛵️ Swedish climate activist @gretathunberg gave up flights to fight climate change. On August 14 she set sail in her zero-carbon yacht to attend the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York. And today she finished her transatlantic journey.

The 16-year-old gained worldwide recognition when she went on strike from school last year to protest her government’s inaction on climate change standing alone with a distinctive hand-lettered sign on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm for three weeks.

Six months later nearly 1.5 million young people in 100 countries worldwide followed suit making March 22 the single largest day of climate action in history. Greta tweeted from her trip on the anniversary of the first #SchoolStrike4climate that “we will go on for as long as it takes.” But even after becoming a global celebrity Thunberg has led by example traveling to events around Europe mainly by train. Flying is indeed having a growing effect on the environment. If you’re a regular flyer odds are that your biggest single source of greenhouse gas emissions each year is air travel. It likely dwarfs the footprint of all the lights in your home your commute to work your hobbies and maybe even your diet. Thunberg’s 15-day sailing trip across the Atlantic shined a spotlight on these issues.

Some Swedish airports have recently reported a decline in travelers which some activists attribute to the “Greta effect” a newfound awareness of humanity’s impacts on the planet and a desire to make a difference. The Swedes have even coined a word for the shame that travelers are beginning to feel about flying: flygskam pronounced “fleeg-skahm.”",schoolstrike4climate,"|Check out @pollsitics if you're interested in debating about social and political issues!|this is awesome|😂😂😂😂 dumb|@pfrelinghuysen19 I like: as the oceans rise so will we|Dumb just stop eating beef|Omg i read « greta gives up the fight with climate change » and For two seconds and I was completely devastated she really represents the last bit of hope I have in human kind...|Telefono para tu amigo dicaprio @diegocardellino|Totally inspiring|Lol let me sail around the world in my YACHT to fight climate change to help impoverished communities that are threatened.|🙌🏽|For Poppy!|Thanks so much for covering it!

Why are they protesting? It all started with a bill that would allow China to extradite Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in court.

⁣
The demonstration is part of a four day sit-in and the latest in a weeks-long protest that was spurred by a new bill that could send #HongKong residents to mainland China to be tried in court. The bill has been halted for now but the protest has evolved into a wider movement calling for democratization and has drawn attention to police brutality as well. Protesters also want their local government to address China’s growing influence in Hong Kong politics arguing that the city was guaranteed a level of independence during its handover to China from Britain and that that guarantee is not being respected.⁣

Hong Kong police have used tear gas and rubber bullets on demonstrators and been accused of wearing plain clothes to blend in with crowds.

16,,,"Toni Morrison the peerless American novelist and Nobel laureate has died at 88. Morrison was the first black woman in history to win the Nobel Prize for Literature and she was a legendary novelist and playwright whose work explored American identity often through overlapping fractured lenses of racial and gender identity.

Morrison didn’t start publishing her own novels until she was nearly 40. But her first novel The Bluest Eye (1970) has come to be considered a classic; her second Sula (1975) was nominated for the National Book Award and brought her critical and popular acclaim that never faded. Beloved the 1988 novel that viscerally depicts the psychological impact of slavery through the story of a woman who kills her child rather than force her to endure a life of enslavement was the rare national bestseller that was also hailed as a literary masterwork.

Beloved won the Pulitzer Prize and Morrison was awarded the Nobel for her body of work in 1993. President Barack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. Her eleventh and final book God Help the Child was published in 2015. Morrison spoke in 2016 about why she started to write: “I read all the time but I was never in those books. Or if I was it was as a joke or as some anecdote that explained something about the main character without the main character looking like me. So I decided that I would write the book that I really and truly wanted to read.” Follow the link in our bio to read more about Toni Morrison’s life and legacy.

17,,,"On Sunday night residents of Dayton Ohio gathered for a vigil after a horrific weekend of gun violence: over the weekend two mass shootings took place in El Paso Texas and Dayton Ohio leaving at least 30 people dead and dozens more injured. The shooting in El Paso took place at a Walmart on Saturday afternoon killing at least 22 people and injuring 26. The shooting in Dayton took place early on Sunday morning in the city’s popular Oregon District leaving at least nine dead and 27 injured. 
Dayton residents gathered Sunday night in the Oregon District for a vigil to mourn the victims. When Ohio Governor Mike DeWine took the stage to speak at the vigil members of the crowd chanted “Do something!” in a frustrated effort to push DeWine to take legislative action against gun violence. 
Gun violence is a uniquely American problem and one that’s gotten worse in recent years: in 2019 alone there have been 255 mass shootings which have left 275 dead and 1065 people injured. And the US is far worse than other developed countries: the US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada more than seven times that of Sweden and nearly 16 times that of Germany.

Until now Saudi Arabia’s “male guardianship system” required women to obtain permission from a father husband or other male relative to exit the country. The law change applies to women over the age of 21 and will include the ability to register births marriages and divorces. And it will ban employment discrimination by gender age or disability expanding work opportunities for women. The move made by the Saudi cabinet is part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to loosen strict social restrictions and change the country’s reputation as one of the world’s most restrictive places for women according to the New York Times.

Last month #Rapinoe made headlines after telling a reporter “I’m not going to the fucking White House” if the US won the Women’s World Cup. The video led President Trump to accuse her of disrespecting her country exhorting Rapinoe to “WIN first before she TALKS!” On the latest Recode Decode Rapinoe sat down with @karaswisher to talk about her decision to kneel in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick and her love of fashion. She also reiterated that she’s still not planning to go to the White House unless she’s being “inaugurated.” But as fate would have it Trump’s attacks on Rapinoe may have actually helped the US women’s team. “I felt like it actually sort of unified the team” she said. “Everyone was like ‘You’re a G Rapinoe!’ Like ‘Get him!’ From the back of the bus. So it kind of unified everyone in that way.

21,,,"American schools still remain highly segregated in 2019. The landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education outlawed school segregation sanctioned by law but a number of factors and government policies — like housing discrimination funding disparities — have made many integration efforts ineffective.  In the decades after Brown v. Board large numbers of white families left cities for richer whiter school districts in the suburbs. And now as those formerly white districts diversify some families and schools are seceding and creating their own essentially gerrymandering mostly white and wealthier households into their borders.

That leaves us with huge disparities between overachieving and underachieving districts — and often these separate and unequal districts are right next to each other. A few miles or even a few blocks can be the difference between attending a high-performing school or a low-performing school. There are nearly 1000 of these stark borders separating districts all across America and nearly 9 million American students or about 1 in 6 are attending schools in disadvantaged districts.

That's what people mean when they say go back where you are from if you find so much to complain about here.  Minority students especially if poor are usually much better off here than they would be in their countries of origin so some people think they should stop finding fault with the white majority who have in fact already provided them with opportunities they might not have otherwise even if they are not on an exact par with middle class and above whites (many poor white students suffer exclusion and discrimination also but it is not as easy to identify and they most often are resigned to excepting their lower class status as the way the world is etc.) It helps when they understand it has more to do with an accident of birth rather than their own failures or shortcomings as they will often be told to believe in a so-called ""meritocracy"". Among those who are the fondest of shaming them for only getting what they deserve because they are obviously inferior in some way  are disgruntled black and Latino ""students"" who like to constantly find fault with all white people refusing to accept the fact that the reason they are minorities is that they are living in a country that was founded and created primarily by Northern Europeans.|Well democrats are anti-school choice so thanks for ahooting yourselves in the foot again.

It’s one of two congressional hearings today to discuss the results of his two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential cooperation between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. He released the full report in April and delivered a statement on the report in May.

While both hearings are expected to deliver some fireworks it’s unclear if any new information will come from them — though of course having Mueller read aloud a report most Americans haven’t sifted through is powerful.

In his opening statement Mueller tried to set the tone: He concisely laid out the findings of his report and indicated he doesn’t plan to stray from them in his testimony. Mueller also emphasized the gravity of the broader matter — a foreign government interfering in US elections. “This deserves the attention of every American” he said.

23,,,"Boris Johnson former UK foreign minister and mayor of London has won the Conservative leadership contest and is slated to be Britain’s next prime minister. A vocal proponent of #Brexit the 55-year-old member of Parliament has said that leaving the European Union by Oct. 31 is “do or die.”⁣
⁣
“We know the mantra of the campaign that has just gone by in case you’ve forgotten it — you probably have. It is: deliver Brexit unite the country and defeat [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn” Johnson said during his victory speech on Tuesday. “And that is what we’re going to do.”⁣

But winning the election might have been the easy part. The UK is still divided over how or whether to break up with the EU. Furthermore Johnson is aiming to renegotiate outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal — and the EU has said it will not renegotiate. ⁣

South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg topped the field with $24.9 million in individual contributions followed by former VP Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris.

These were the only five candidates to raise more than $11 million in the quarter (between April 1 and June 30).

28,,,"After a devastating fire in April that destroyed much of France’s historic Notre Dame Cathedral many of the country’s major companies and billionaires including the heiress to L’Oreal and the CEO of Louis Vuitton’s parent company pledged to help fund its reconstruction. But three months later they still have yet to make good on their word and actually donate according to a cathedral spokesperson.

Why the wait? It’s likely that the French donors aren’t as interested in the dirty — but essential — cleanup work needed before the reconstruction can begin and would rather be involved in the seemingly more glamorous work of shaping the cathedral’s new architectural vision for posterity. ""It's a voluntary donation so the companies are waiting for the government's vision to see what precisely they want to fund"" said Celia Verot director general of the Fondation du Patrimoine one of the French government's four official charity partners.

The success of the US women’s team has drawn attention to pay disparity between male and female players. According to FIFA the US women’s team is ranked first in the world. The US men’s team is currently ranked 30th in the world but those players earn more when they lose than players on the women’s team earn when it wins. Women players earn a base salary of $3600 per game while men earn $5000. Women who play on the world stage — like in the World Cup — get a $15000 bonus; male soccer players earn a bonus of $55000.

In 2015 the US Soccer Federation awarded the women’s team $1.7 million for winning the World Cup. One year prior the federation awarded the men’s national team a $5.4 million bonus for losing in the round of 16 in the 2014 World Cup. In response to this pay disparity 28 members of the women’s national team — including Rapinoe — have sued the US Soccer Federation for gender discrimination.",uswnt,"|And they generate higher ratings and revenue|My girlfriend broke up with me.

31,,,"This is huge: Disney’s forthcoming live-action Little Mermaid is set to star actress and singer Halle Bailey of the R&B duo @chloexhalle as Ariel. That means that one of Disney’s most iconic princesses is going to look quite different. This Ariel will be black.

And it’s a big deal for another reason too: Ariel is also the princess whose character design set the mold for the astonishingly homogenous run of giant-eyed small-nosed Disney princesses we’ve met since The Little Mermaid debuted in 1989. “Same Face Syndrome” is most noticeable in Disney’s current era of CGI animation but it goes back to the traditional animation of the Disney Renaissance. Classic Disney heroines like Beauty and the Beast’s Belle Aladdin’s Jasmine and Tarzan’s Jane all share the basic Disney “Same Face” character modeling — round face big eyes small nose.

For the past 30 years Disney has been selling a very specific face as its cultural ideal for girls one that is anatomically impossible but that exaggerates mostly European features. And now the white red-headed character who originated that face is going to be reimagined as a black girl.

This is a total solar eclipse and one just happened today. This afternoon a shadow fell over the southern Pacific Ocean and parts of Chile and Argentina. It’s the first total solar eclipse since the “Great American Eclipse” of August 2017 which bisected the continental US.

A total solar eclipse is a beautiful phenomenon. (People say witnessing a total solar eclipse is life-changing.) When the moon covers the sun it reveals a glowing white light surrounding the sun. That’s the solar corona or atmosphere and it’s only visible to our eyes during an eclipse. Here’s what #EclipseSolar2019 looked like on Tuesday.",eclipsesolar2019,"|😩|⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

33,,,"Tens of thousands of Hongkongers took to the streets and stormed the legislative building on Monday to protest what they see as China's increasing influence over the city-state. On July 1 1997 Britain handed Hong Kong over to China on the condition that Hong Kong would largely govern itself for another 50 years. But many in Hong Kong see a controversial new extradition bill as a sign that Beijing is trying to cut that timeline short and they’re fighting back.

The bill would allow Hong Kong authorities to arrest people and extradite them to face trial in mainland China on a case-by-case basis. The proposal has become part of a larger fight to preserve the independence of a democratic Hong Kong and the freedom of speech that goes with it.

34,,,"People across New York City and San Francisco celebrated Pride Month one more time over the weekend before June came to an end. The idea behind the movement according to one of the original organizers of the march in NYC was to commemorate the Stonewall Riots and move away from a conservatism that had mired LGBTQ organizations at the time.

The first Pride March took place in 1970 and since then the movement has evolved into a political protest activist cornerstone and colorful celebration. In recent years Pride Month has been marked by celebration — over the US Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide as well as some of the other progress made in LGBTQ rights in American politics.

But this year Pride celebrations fall in a markedly different atmosphere. Although LGBTQ advocates have seen big gains in recent years the election of President Donald Trump and recent policy efforts against LGBTQ rights — from Trump’s ban on transgender people serving in the military to anti-transgender bathroom bills in North Carolina and Texas — have shown just how fragile these gains can be.

Despite the less supportive political climate the LGBTQ+ community has marched on — declaring Pride a time to feel their most comfortable and confident in their own skin.

Temperatures in some cities have topped 105°F (40°C) breaking records. And the heat is widespread: There’s nowhere to beat the heat from Portugal to Poland.

At German zoos animals especially prone to the heat like meerkats and lemurs are getting frozen ice pops to beat the heat. One tapir even got an application of sunscreen from a zookeeper.

Elsewhere across the continent officials have declared heat warnings canceled events and set up cooling stations for people to cool down.

During any summer such heat waves are possible. But in a warming world more are expected.

What followed was a mass exodus of people that separated families and communities sparked violence and led to generations of pain.

The impact of this arbitrary line masks the reality of the common bonds between people on both sides: Indians and Pakistanis.

@johnnywharris traveled to #Punjab to meet with the communities impacted firsthand — Sikhs Hindus Muslims — and explore the realities of post-partition life.

India should never have been divided. They were living in peace with their Muslim friends and neighbors for centuries without the hatred. Now the hatred is being instilled in people by politicians. Same people same nation should be able to live in peace without hatred regardless of religion. Religion should not be an instrument of hate it should encourage wisdom and love for all. All religions teach us the same. Terrorist and extremists have wielded religion for their own purposes. Education should teach us not to fall prey to these sick ideologies. We should learn to live in peace with our fellow humans for the survival of our planet.|A brilliant report and playback captured on both nations.

41,,,"Dozens of women are building careers out of Instagram feeds full of huge guns and perfect smiles. Some of them are hunters some of them are veterans some play soccer or swing-dance. And they’ve all done something that companies in the firearm industry cannot do on their own: make the gun lifestyle as attractive and aspirational as all the others on social media.

Facebook and Instagram ban ads that promote the sale or use of firearms. So gun companies turn to women like @misslaurenvictoriaa — and yes gun influencers are mostly women — to market their products instead skirting ad restrictions in the process. If you follow their accounts you'll see photos of assault rifles and gun safes alongside selfies and engagement pictures. Vox's Kaitlyn Tiffany spoke to these women about their love of guns and how they became some of the most powerful influencers on the internet. Follow the link in our bio to learn more.

42,,,"The US national women’s soccer team beat Thailand’s team 13-0 Tuesday. That’s more goals than the men’s national soccer team has scored in every World Cup series since 2006 combined. And the achievement has led to increased calls for the women to be paid the same as their male counterparts.

The US women’s soccer team is currently engaged in a lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation claiming its members face “purposeful gender discrimination.” The team is the best in the world and has been for a very long time. But despite the women’s history of successes on the field the US Soccer Federation pays women players far less than men — in fact the group pays men more when they lose than it pays women when they win.

The numbers as outlined by ESPN: the women would earn $99000 each if they win 20 friendlies (matches that don’t count in any standings) the minimum they are required to play in a year. But the men would likely earn $263320 each for the same feat — not to mention $100000 even if they lost all 20 games.

The lawsuit claims the discrimination isn’t only in pay but also what the players see as discrimination in every aspect of their work — from training to travel to promotion. The US women’s soccer team expects to go to trial after the World Cup is over. Follow the link in our bio to learn more about their fight for pay equity. #USWNT #WorldCup",uswnt worldcup,"|I hope they win their lawsuit|Hueónas secas por la chucha!|Well then bring in more fans|Be more popular|Did u see the match.|less viewership less profit= less pay|Wow you know how to thrash another team.

43,,,"A top court in Botswana has decriminalized homosexuality marking one of the greatest victories for #LGBTQ rights on the continent ever.

Botswana’s penal code which dates back to the 1960s when the southern African country was a British colony contained laws that directly discriminated against same-sex couples. Letsweletse Motshidiemang a 21-year-old student at the University of Botswana took the government to court in March because he felt it should no longer discriminate against same-sex relationships. Botswana’s High Court ruled in his favor only three months later.

The hope now is that the law change will make the life of many LGBTQ Botswanans much better. But the jubilation in Botswana is tempered by the many problems still facing the LGBTQ community in much of Africa. There’s still a long way to go for total acceptance on the continent: just two weeks ago Kenya — one of the continent’s most powerful countries — upheld its discriminatory laws against LGBTQ individuals despite a staunch legal challenge.

44,,,"On Sunday night @alistroker took home the Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her role as Ado Annie in the dark and gritty revival of Oklahoma. That makes Stroker the first wheelchair-using performer to win a Tony ever. “This award is for every kid who is watching tonight who has a disability who has a limitation or a challenge who has been waiting to see themselves represented in this arena” she said as she accepted her award. “You are.” It’s worth noting that Stroker’s win also highlighted how poorly set up the theater community is to work with the disabled. As Stroker pointed out after her speech while most Broadway theaters work to make themselves accessible to disabled audiences backstage they’re mostly inaccessible. And that fact was more than clear at the Tonys: When Stroker won she had to wheel herself out from backstage because if she’d been sitting in the audience with the rest of the nominees there would have been no ramp available for her to use to get onto the stage itself.

45,,,"HBO’s acclaimed fantasy series about betrayal fighting families abuse an extremely fierce mother death an illegitimate son and a wicked wine-sipping queen has returned. Big Little Lies’ second season debuts tonight at 9 pm ET.

After its debut in 2017 the show — which boasts a superstar cast featuring Reese Witherspoon Nicole Kidman Laura Dern Shailene Woodley and Zoë Kravitz — swiftly became a phenomenon. Based on the novel of the same name by Liane Moriarty Big Little Lies was initially going to be an open-and-shut miniseries. It covered the entire novel — including its heart-stopping ending — in seven episodes. But even though the show had exhausted its source material HBO understandably wanted to capitalize on its popularity and ordered with some scrutiny from critics a second season.

The new season feels a bit different at least in its early episodes. And that’s not just because Big Little Lies has progressed beyond its source material or because the deity known as Meryl Streep is joining the cast. It’s also a bit lighter in tone and simultaneously more grounded.

46,,,"“The actions taken by the NYPD were wrong — plain and simple. The actions and the laws were discriminatory and oppressive and for that I apologize.” Those words – a mea culpa nearly 50 years in the making – were spoken yesterday by New York’s police commissioner who apologized for the actions police officers took during the Stonewall uprising of June 1969. 
Throughout the late 1960s it was common for police to raid gay establishments simply to harass LGBTQ people. That included places like the Stonewall Inn a gay- and trans-friendly bar in Greenwich Village. Homophobic abuse was just business as usual. 
But there was something different about the night of June 28 1969. This time Stonewall patrons fought back against police and everyone from gay men to trans women of color went on to riot for four consecutive nights. It was a show of strength that marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQ rights movement. 
The pride marches happening around the country this month are a direct legacy of that night 50 years ago and of the people who were there willing to stand up against oppression and fight for their rights. Follow the link in our bio to read more.

48,,,"Today special counsel Robert Mueller made his first public comments about the Trump-Russia investigation — and his remarks stood in stark contrast to the president’s “no collusion no obstruction” mantra.

In his statement Mueller contradicted Attorney General Bill Barr refused to clear Trump on obstruction of justice and signaled that he does not want to testify before Congress. He stressed that “there were multiple systematic efforts” by Russian officers to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and damage candidate Hillary Clinton. This was a “concerted attack on our political system” he said and “that allegation deserves the attention of every American.” Speaking about potential obstruction of justice Mueller said that his team “could not consider” charging President Trump with a crime given long-standing policy that a sitting president can not be charged while in office. But that doesn’t mean Trump is exonerated: “If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so” Mueller said. With the investigation completed the Justice Department is formally closing the special counsel's office and he is resigning to return to private life. That means whatever happens next will be up to Congress. Follow the link in our bio to learn more. #politics #mueller #muellernews",politics mueller muellernews,"|⚜️ #BradyLaw|MAGA 🤘🏽.

Detective Son finds evidence that Dad cheated on Mom so he writes a 400-page paper describing the events concluding “Dad did not NOT cheat on Mom. 3. Mom says “What will the neighbors say if I kick him out?” 4. Son stands on the roof and shouts “Hey everyone!! Dad didn’t not cheat on Mom!! Don’t be mad at her!”|Get over it.

49,,,"Missouri became the latest state to severely restrict abortion rights on Friday.

Gov. Mike Parson signed a law that would ban abortion at 8-weeks gestation except in case of a medical emergency with no exceptions for rape and incest. This follows four states — Kentucky Mississippi Georgia and Ohio — that have passed so-called “heartbeat bills” which outlaw abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. That can happen as early as six weeks before many women even know they’re pregnant. Alabama meanwhile passed a law earlier this month that bans abortion at any stage of pregnancy unless the life of the pregnant person is at risk. None of these restrictions have taken effect yet and abortion is still legal in all 50 states. But the wave of new laws passed in 2019 shows that the anti-abortion movement is pursuing more aggressive tactics and it could be the start of a prolonged legal battle over Roe v. Wade and the future of abortion rights in America.

This paper presents a triobjective model for optimization of allocated exchange portfolio. The objectives of this model are minimizing risk and investment initial cost (by adopting two synchronic policies of buying and selling assets) and maximizing return to optimize allocated portfolios (APs). In an AP an investor by considering previous investment experiences and market conditions selects the within portfolio assets. Then considering proposed model the assets proportion of AP is optimized for a limited time horizon. In optimizing a multiobjective problem of an AP risk and return objectives are measured on the basis of standard deviation of assets dairy return and dairy return mean within AP assets respectively. We present a set of interobjectives trade-offs along with an analysis of Iran Melli bank investment in an exchange AP using Weighted Global Criterion (WGC) method with assumption 𝑝 = 1 2 and ∞ to optimize the proposed model. Results of WGC model (in all p = 1 2 and ∞) represent that US dollar exchange in comparison with other exchanges was rather the fewest exchange proportion in Iran Melli bank exchange AP which this is consistent with Iran exchange investment policy of more concen|If you need to hack into any database delete record improve credit score spy on whatsapp text phone emails as long as it's hack contact ME  Whats- App : +1- 8572- 144- 678 very cheap and fast.|@_._n.o.o.n.e_._._ relax  i’m over this . leave me alone|How can a recent college grad from a Power5 conference school apply for a career?|Leave PewDiePie out of your mouth you twisted company of snowflakes|@voxdotcom you have some beautiful individuals that hide behind fake accounts and love to abort children I see 🤣|@rolly_dodgers|All i have to say is yall just staged the most pathetic “walk out” in the history of our planet.. and im not surprised since i wouldnt even wipe my ass with anything vox has a hand in..🤣🤣🤣|God bless Missouri|🙏🙏|Awww damn I really wanted to kill some babies|BABYS LIVES MATTER|👏👏👏🇺🇸 going in a good direction|Being that a child is two people's work.

Let the one who does wrong still do wrong; and the one who is filthy still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous still practice righteousness; and the one who is holy still keep himself holy.” “Behold I am coming quickly and My reward is with Me to render to every man according to what he has done.  I am the Alpha and the Omega the first and the last the beginning and the end.” Blessed are those who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city. Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices lying. “I Jesus have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David the bright morning star.” The Spirit and the bride say “Come.” And let the one who hears say “Come.” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost.  I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city which are written in this book.  He who testifies to these things says “Yes I am coming quickly.” Amen. Come Lord Jesus.  The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.

50,,,"During the Gilded Age steel magnate Andrew Carnegie — arguably the country’s first large-scale philanthropist — financed the construction of nearly 1700 libraries across the US as a way to give back. But could that really make up for the thousands of workers who were killed and maimed in his mills? Those employees even if they survived were working too many hours to be able to check out and read library books.

Today’s megaphilanthropists might not run brutal steel mills. But they are just like Carnegie asking us to focus less on how they earned their money and more on how they give it away.

On the brand new season of the Future Perfect podcast we take a look at donations in our modern Gilded Age. Over the course of eight episodes host Dylan Matthews will tackle big gifts big donors and big questions like: what do huge injections of private money do to a democracy?

Conlangs are officially a Pop Culture Thing. Part of the deluge seems to stem from audiences’ never-ending quest for “authenticity” the desire for meticulous televisual world building. And film and TV creators have adopted a similar mindset — a yearning for verisimilitude that extends all the way to shelling out to have new languages written even as natural languages are disappearing at the rate of one every two weeks.

52,,,"Taiwan’s parliament just voted to legalize same-sex marriage making it the first place in Asia to do so. 
Advocates and supporters of same-sex marriage awaited the results of the vote outside parliament and celebrated and cheered Friday when it was announced that it had approved the legislation. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen who’s led the self-governing island since 2016 must still sign the legislation which she’s expected to do. “We took a big step towards true equality and made Taiwan better” Taiwan’s President wrote on Twitter after the vote. 
Taiwan has been one of the more progressive places in Asia in regards to gay rights and has long hosted the biggest gay pride parade in the region.

Other countries have made some halting progress. For example Thailand drafted a bill allowing same-sex civil partnerships last year. But a gay-rights activist in Hong Kong told the BBC that she didn’t think Taiwan’s decision would make a difference in more conservative places like mainland China and Hong Kong. China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 though the Chinese government has continued at times to crack down LGBTQ advocacy.

But advocates still see the legalization of same-sex marriage in Taiwan as offering an example for the rest of the region. Follow the link in our bio to read more.

Game of Thrones costume designer @MicheleClapton has reflected their indvidual experiences and family history through elaborate costumes on which every detail is strategic and meaningful.

In #GameOfThronesSeason8 Sansa and Cersei default to military-style accents on their gowns as they prep for battle. Those high-necked dresses evoke images of each family’s armor — full of defensive details like epaulets and draped chains. And while both leaders have learned different lessons about war and family it’s safe to say their outfit parallels are there for a reason.

55,,,"The theme of last night’s Met Gala was “camp.” But not camp like tents and sleeping bags. Camp like…over-the-top exaggerated spectacle.

Camp as an aesthetic is nearly impossible to define. Camp has no interest in traditional ideas of beauty or good taste. It wants exuberant fakery. It wants to explode boundaries. It’s characterized by gleeful excess and artificiality. And it has long been a tool of queer and marginalized people to challenge cultural norms (drag and camp are inextricably linked for instance). The complicated and perhaps uncapturable nature of camp has sparked some bitter debates over which celebrities “got” the theme of last night’s event. But some people undeniably nailed it: Lady Gaga is a camp icon. Katy Perry as a chandelier? Total camp. Billy Porter as Cleopatra carried by six shirtless gold-swathed Broadway actors? Absolutely camp. Follow the link in our bio to see who else captured camp and who missed the mark (ahem Giselle Bündchen). #MetGala",metgala,"|@srinjitv|And how were the men dressed?

56,,,"Plant-based meat is going mainstream. 
Earlier this week @burgerking announced that all 7200 of its US branches will start serving the Impossible Whopper by the end of the year. The 100% meatless burger is a partnership with the startup company Impossible Foods and is made with heme a protein cultivated from soybean roots that mimics the texture of meat. 
Less than a month a month ago the fast-food chain announced it was giving the Impossible Whopper a trial run in 59 restaurants in the St. Louis area. The results were so promising that the company has already decided to offer the Impossible Whopper nationwide. 
Does it seem counterintuitive for a meat-focused chain like Burger King to get in on the #vegan meat alternative movement? Maybe. But plant-based burgers make a lot of business sense since meat alternatives are becoming more and more popular with consumers and could turn a huge profit for Burger King.

58,,,"Nearly 300 people were killed and around 500 others were injured in eight coordinated attacks on churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday. The bombings mark some of the worst violence the country has seen since the end of its civil war a decade ago. 
Christians are a minority in Sri Lanka and the majority of Christians in the country are Roman Catholic. Easter is one of Christianity’s holiest days and many Sri Lankan Christians were worshipping at church when the attacks took place.

The Sri Lankan government has identified National Thowheeth Jama’ath a small Islamist terrorist organization as the group behind the assault. Though no one has come forward yet and claimed responsibility at least 24 people are in custody in relation to the attacks. Police have imposed two 12-hour curfews since the attack spanning from nightfall to sunrise local time. The government also temporarily cut off access to Facebook and Whatsapp in order to prevent the spread of misinformation. 
Sri Lanka’s prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe released a statement on Sunday condemning the “cowardly attacks on our people” and asked “all Sri Lankans during this tragic time to remain united and strong.” According to reports authorities had intelligence the terrorists planned to target churches with suicide attacks though it appears that nothing was done about it.

60,,,"The (redacted) #MuellerReport is finally here and it reveals an incredible moment that occurred after President Trump learned in May 2017 that Robert Mueller had been appointed as special counsel. Upon hearing he would be investigated Trump’s first reaction was “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m fucked” according to the notes kept by Jody Hunt then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s chief of staff. According to the report Trump then said “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won't be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.""

The cause of the fire is not yet clear but police told the Guardian it appeared to be an accident linked to restoration work. The approximately 800-year-old church which is one of Paris’s most iconic attractions has been in desperate need of repairs.

64,,,"In terms of its color at least #GameofThrones is more fire than ice — for now.

Vox's Kavya Sukumar analyzed the series’ use of color in all 67 episodes so far capturing the screen every 10 seconds and averaging the colors in each image. We found that scenes where the average color is warm — that is closer to red than blue — outnumber the ones with cold colors.

65,,,Sansa Stark has arguably taken the most interesting personal journey of any character on #GameOfThrones — from an innocent but shallow teen with delusions of royalty to a quiet resolute leader who has survived more horrific things than you can imagine. Through it all she’s worn her allegiances and defiance quite literally on her sleeves. From romantic stitched dresses to royal metallic belts to the black crow dress Sansa’s wardrobe and styling tell her story. Over seven seasons Sansa’s look is influenced by other characters — namely Cersei Lannister and Margaery Tyrell — but always distinctly mirrors her personal arc. She wears girdled gowns when she is entrapped and confused and clothing that’s like armor as she grows into a leader. Throughout the show we see her signature dragonfly details fur nods to her northern heritage and fish clasps to honor her mother’s house.

66,,,@ocasio2018 used vibrant yellows and purples exclamation points and stars for her campaign merchandise during last year’s midterms. @realdonaldtrump of course has a heavy red white and blue logo with a stars-and stripes-border. Voters might not realize it but graphic design plays an important role in political campaigns alerting us to how a candidate wants to be seen by the public. So what do the 2020 contenders’ logos tell us? We asked three experts to explain. Several campaigns are using bright bold design and poppy colors. That’s likely an effort to signal something fresh and current. And in such a crowded field candidates are trying to use their designs to differentiate themselves. @kirstengillibrand for one isn’t shying away from the color pink using it to signal that she’s a candidate that will stand for women and a mother of two teenage sons.

67,,,"Ever since physicists first conceived of black holes centuries ago every image has been an illustration. Until now. The first-ever black hole photo taken by an international collaboration of scientists called the Event Horizon Telescope was just revealed.

This supermassive black hole at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy is a beast with a mass of 6.5 billion suns. The force of its gravity propels jets of plasma moving at near the speed of light that are some 4000 light years long.

When viewed from Earth this black hole is extremely small. Just how small exactly? Taking a photo of this black hole is like taking a photo of a quarter in Los Angeles all the way from Washington DC. To see such a small object researchers needed a telescope the size of the Earth.

68,,,"Two key White House staffers are out this week: President Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen abruptly resigned on Sunday night followed by Randolph “Tex” Alles director of Secret Service who was ousted on Monday. 
Nielsen was arguably one of the most aggressive immigration hawks in the department’s short history and took several unprecedented steps to crack down on asylum and migration — but for Trump her policies still weren’t tough enough. (It’s worth noting though that in historical context illegal border crossings are way down: apprehensions have plummeted from a high of 1.6 million in 2000 to just 396607 in 2018 according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection — and families and children traveling alone have been rising.) Meanwhile just last week Trump said that he “could not be happier” with the Secret Service which has “done a fantastic job from day one.” There are conflicting reports and speculation on whether the ouster of Alles is related to the Secret Service’s arrest of a 32-year-old Chinese woman Yujing Zhang in late March who allegedly breached security at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort carrying multiple electronic devices. But Alles said that contrary to reports he was not fired and was told “weeks ago” by the administration that “transitions in leadership should be expected” across DHS. #politics #news #trump",politics news trump,"|Can someone compare this with “departures” in an average presidency?|Firing everyone that disagrees with him.

70,,,It is a persistent fact — across time and across countries — that women earn less money than men. In the United States women earn about 79 cents to every dollar a man earns. In Japan women earn 73% of what a man does. In Denmark it’s about 85% Look across the world and you won’t find a country where men and women have equal earnings. So the big question is why? A 2018 study out of Denmark offers a compelling explanation: The gender wage gap is mostly a penalty for bearing children. Women see a sharp decline in their earnings after the birth of their first child — with no comparable salary drop for men. The cumulative effect is huge: Women end up earning 20 percent less than their male counterparts over the course of their career. Meanwhile research has shown that childless women have earnings that are quite similar to men’s. Follow the link in our bio to learn more about why the gender wage gap is often really a motherhood penalty. #EqualPayDay #WomensEquality #motherhood #feminism #wagegap #paidleave,equalpayday womensequality motherhood feminism wagegap paidleave,"|Danish women don't quit their jobs when they have kids - we have excellent childcare services so it's not either or.|@baleelah99|What about the birth gap?

My husband tried to take off of work for 2 days to take care of our feverish child and his boss literally told him to come in to the office. I have so many more frustrating examples that I won't mention here but the gender pay gap/motherhood penalty is real. The faster we realize this the faster we can correct it.

72,,,Special counsel Robert Mueller has officially submitted a report about his Trump-Russia probe concluding an investigation into election interference and possible collusion that began nearly three years ago. But we don’t know what it says — yet. Now it’s up to Attorney General Bill Barr to decide how much of Mueller’s report becomes public.  So far we know the report will not recommend any new indictments according to a senior Justice Department official. The biggest unanswered question is what the report will say about President Trump himself. Does it make clear Mueller does not believe Trump engaged in any criminal activity? Or does it lay out a prosecutorial fact pattern about the president as a potential prelude to impeachment?

73,,,Tourists are flocking to sites threatened by climate change — like the Galápagos Islands the Florida Reef and Montana’s National Glacier Park — to see them “before they’re gone.” The problem is that only makes things worse. Tourism spurs the development of hotels and other attractions that threaten or displace wildlife. Chemicals in sunscreen contribute to coral bleaching. Air travel emits greenhouse gases that fuel rising sea temperatures. And the influx of visitors itself can take its toll on vulnerable habitats too. By visiting these fragile ecosystems travelers are actually accelerating their demise. And as cities try to deal with the damage tourism leaves behind that raises a key question: How does a region limit an industry that drives its economy?

74,,,"Last Friday two shootings at mosques in Christchurch New Zealand left 50 people dead and 50 more injured. The shooter a 28-year-old Australian man wrote a manifesto expressing white nationalist and anti-Muslim views. People around the world mourned the tragedy and expressed support for and solidarity with the Muslim community in New Zealand. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joined them as well wearing a hijab while she visited with Muslim mourners in Christchurch. 
Ardern and her administration have responded swiftly to the attacks promising on Friday that “our gun laws will change.” New Zealand already has strong gun laws but the debate over gun control has taken on a new sense of urgency in the wake of last week’s shootings. The country’s Attorney General David Parker also said that the country is looking into potentially banning semi-automatic weapons.

75,,,"An estimated 1 million young people in 123 countries — from Australia to India to Sweden to South Africa — skipped school Friday to demand stronger climate policies in what may be the largest environmental protest in world history.

Swedish activist and strike leader Greta Thunberg 16 began a school strike in front of Sweden’s parliament in August and soon inspired students in other cities to join her on Fridays in what became the #FridaysforFuture movement. “This movement had to happen we didn’t have a choice” Thunberg said with other young climate activists in the Guardian Friday. “We knew there was a climate crisis ... We knew because everything we read and watched screamed out to us that something was very wrong.” What Thunberg and her fellow protestors want from their governments is to “keep fossil fuels in the ground phase out subsidies for dirty energy production seriously invest in renewables and start asking difficult questions about how we structure our economies and who is set to win and who is set to lose” as they put it in the Guardian. And they have the backing of thousands of scientists who’ve signed letters of support. #ClimateStrike",fridaysforfuture climatestrike,"|✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽|Our best hope.|Our best hope.|@pacohj96 diputado mire|@theo_steele_  ignore the comments because people are dicks it was so moving to see it happening on my way to work - I didn't realize it was simultaneously happening internationally that day!|@mari.coelho__ o mundo ta chato demais... ainda bem😍|This is amazing.

76,,,It’s official: Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke is running for president. O’Rourke became a rising star of the Democratic Party when he came within 2 points of ousting Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterms. He lost that race but the campaign won him national attention and showed that a Democrat could be competitive in deep-red Texas. O’Rourke doesn’t have a singular message or a prescriptive set of policy proposals. But he does have a liberal set of values and a whole lot of charisma — which helped him harness progressive grassroots energy last fall.

77,,,Captain Marvel soared to uncharted territory at the box office in its opening weekend bringing in a $153 million domestic haul and $455 worldwide — the sixth largest worldwide opening weekend in history. And it achieved these numbers despite the efforts of trolls who tried to sink the movie’s online audience scores. (Critically the movie has been met with mostly positive reviews.) Captain Marvel carries a lot of industry pressure; it’s Marvel Studios’ first female solo superhero movie (in its current cinematic universe). The movie’s big opening weekend will presumably encourage Hollywood’s decision-makers to greenlight more movies featuring women in roles that cinema hasn’t traditionally made available to them including superheroes. #CaptainMarvel,captainmarvel,|♥️♥️♥️|Its fantastic movie|First solo female movie? Was wonder woman not one? I didn't see either so real question.|Interesting how wonder women and Alita were both hated cause of a female leading role... oh wait|Wonder Woman is a shitty movie from DC|@twentysomething____ its making a lot of money|There's no one to blame but the movie itself. It stinks.|So the movie is important bc it has a female lead? That’s it? That’s why it’s important? You do realize that you achieve the “equality” you’ve been looking for by not reacting to every single female lead like this. Just talk abt how the movie performed and why it did which doesn’t even touch the topic of sex/gender. This is a bullshit post|Did u see the same movie i saw? It was fuckin horrible! I was so bored and slept half way! I want my $ back!|And it wasn’t very good but what do I know I’m just a white dude 🤠|Wait why is it bad and why does everyone hate it? Pls tell me|I thought it was a great movie way better than anything DC has put out yet|I liked it and I dont generally like super hero movies.|I loved the movie - for the movie itself and for what it represents. ❤️|@rita_alawieh2006 😍😍|Lol when you ignore all movies from the past with strong female lead characters and choose to be mad because this is the first one in the Marvel Universe. 😂 pathetic. Snowflakes are just upset that majority of people who watched it didn’t like the movie.|This movie tried really hard but the writing was trash|your list for worst to best marvel movies sucks. the fact that you most likely just watched the movies to criticize it for it’s social justice factors and relations is just sad. entertainment and story are the most important elements of movies but you somehow thought winter soldier was better than infinity war because Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans really have a good damn friendship? Or Black Panther is better than Iron Man because it’s “thoughtful consideration of the nature of power methods of social change and the shameful history of race relations”? it’s truly sad the fact that the movies have only been ranked by people with similar standards and focus’. maybe try enjoying the movie and build from there but don’t say that these are definitively ranked because that statement would be definitively idiotic. thanks.|Catwoman was the main character of Batman Returns 30 years ago and it wayyyyy more interesting and real than this boring cookie-cutter marvel cgi fest|Heard it sucked balls|So glad the trolls didn't sink this film. Not all of the jokes landed but I really enjoyed it.#captainmarvel|Weak|Garbage|You and your website are cancer. Please die Vox|The movie is watchable. I would have LOVED a scarlet witch movie. Strong rumors suggest not even the faces within the MCU feel it’s right or fair that Captain Marvel comes out of nowhere and is THE most powerful. Definite shoe-horn because they could not develop ADAM WARLOCK (HIM) teased in GOTG.. properly. None of this is based on bringing a woman in the mix as SW is ultimately more powerful-It has to be something more. I’m sure the producers were sexist and wanted a slightly more attractive blonde...in the end a movie promoting itself in this way...is still controlled by sexism. 🤷🏻‍♂️|This movie was horrible|It’s almost as sad a dragon ball evolution|👎🏽|Pretty disappointing movie|I loved the movie and Captain Marvel as a character but Brie Larson in recent years has turned into a an arrogant bitch who thinks she is better than everyone else.|455 dollars is all this made worldwide? Seems right.|This movie sucked|Brie Larson is not a role model for young women. Brie Larson is a role model for batshit crazy feminazi women who got their heart broke by 1 white dude is now lesbo & hates  straight white males. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂|Worst movie ever made|Telling the truth does not equate to trolling. Neither does an opinion that doesn’t suit this dogturd narrative of vox. Brie is a poor actress and a racist and the film is woefully bad from plot to cgi. This was nothing more than a big old bag of virtue signalling crap.|Looking at her makes me feel violated.  Please take this image down!  #imscared #feelingunsafe|It’s not “ uncharted territory” if it’s 6th place. #voxiscancer|This account should be deleted for every bodies sake|👎👎👎👎👎|Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!|💀💀💀|It was pretty good 🤷🏼‍♂️|Did not expect that at all 😮|@manny_pinedo  you’re one of those trolls|All the yassss!!!!|@graceyjlyu|I've already been informed our next cat will be named Goose.|Thats good to hear. I feel however that they just shoe horned this movie in. If they wanted a women they could have gone with someone who was already apart of the MCU like blackwidow for example Or Scarlett witch.|It was an average movie and rotten tomatoes is removing reviews so|movie was stale|Still no ass|@hannahgreengables|@voxdotcom  Correction in your post : it is not $455 but $455 million|@adam_____bomb I see u|$455 worldwide? That’s a lot|@voxdotcom a sentence should never start with “and”.|Nobody liked the movie. Under60% rotten tomato rating|@kschadhauser !!!!!|59% audience score and 64% metacritic lmao|Im all in for diversity and female leads. That being said Captain Marvel have a terrible script and god bless Brie she did what she could with what she was handed.|@autumnskye|😯|Movie was sucks|Too bad it was an average movie @wickopecka|@indiebeanie we should go see this just for support|It’s an ok film. The hype is just because of endgame coming soon. It doesn’t have a great script or an interesting villain. It’s just there|Saw it. Thought it was good but not great. Then I began thinking about it and want to see it again. I think it’s one of those films that will keep improving as you watch it again and again.|❤️|On one hand it’s fantastic to see a great female superhero. On the other hand it’s a shame that women need to emulate men.|Will be seeing the movie tomorrow. But I'm sure the trolls are not sexist in anyway. They are trolling because the makers (probably) feel that they can get away with a weak script and lesser effort just because the film has  a female lead and it has a marvel banner.|That movie was great and did exactly what it needed to do for Brie Larson/Captain Marvel to carry the next gen of the MCU.,4791
78,,,Why are some Instagram posts downright hostile to people who drink decaf? Photos and quotes celebrating the morning coffee routine abound. You know the ones: They range from the cutesy (“But first coffee”) to the self-deprecating (“I’m sorry for what I said before I had my coffee”) to the vaguely threatening (“I drink coffee for your protection”). Yet we live in an era where dairy-free milk is a $2 billion industry going gluten-free is cool and “wellness” is valued above all else. So why is caffeine — an addictive stimulant — still king? Decaf’s bad reputation is in part built on its bitter origins: 20 or 30 years ago the decaf blends available simply tasted bad. Yet the hate persists despite the change for the better in taste. Follow the link in our bio to learn why. #coffee #deathbeforedecaf #caffeineaddict #health #wellness,coffee deathbeforedecaf caffeineaddict health wellness,|@rmarmstr my thoughts exactly. Simple but yet effective. Never decaf.|Its like non-alcoholic beer. Just why?|“Vaguely threatening.” Oml I love you @voxdotcom|Is this really that big of a problem vox/people who hate pewds?|Sounds about right. Like drinking non alcoholic beer|Yeah I see fights everyday at the coffee shop straight up stabbings over decaf🤣🤣🤣👌|I drank too much coffee after having kids and I found the headaches I got when I forgot to drink it or didn’t have time to make it overwhelming. I like the taste of coffee but I don’t like being addicted to stuff. I went to decaf and get so much crap especially from mom friends. I never talk about t unless it comes up where I have to order it around people or something. Not sure either why it offends people so much. I’ll read this article for sure|@ltrostle|Just have water ✌🏼|@rachel.changg caffeine is king|Great feed! 🔥|@evandotas why is Vox calling me out like this|I just had my first cup of decaf today and it totally made sense. I used to think who the hell wanted to drink this fake stuff. But I realized caffeine was causing me to get jittery and sweaty at my desk at work and I would still have it. Then I discovered decaf! Now I can enjoy the flavor without the sometimes unwanted side effects|🙏Thank you @voxdotcom! I recently made the switch to decaf at the recommendation of my doctor and I was reluctant to switch because of the horror stories of how bad/bland decaf tasted. But since I switched two months ago I haven’t looked back.|The only think more dangerous than a beaver is a caffeinated beaver.|@devin_clarin reminds me of your new ink|Decaf generally still tastes worse.|@samanthasaramarti|😃|@marymackenzie_7 “I’m sorry what I said before I had my coffee”...sounds like you|Enjoyed this piece. As a 30something coffee snob who originally went off caffeine last year to curb some digestive woes and has stayed off it so far I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how much good decaf I can find—but it isn’t everywhere! Still as you say in the piece the bad rep of decaf from a couple decades ago is really outdated. I occasionally do drink caffeine now and it has a much more stimulating effect (bonus!) than it did when I was addicted.|i have anxiety and i had to switch to decaf after getting panic attacks directly caused by the caffeine. people are always asking me why i get decaf at 8 in the morning and i should probably start asking them why they still drink caffeinated coffee 💀💀💀|😃😃😃|Where are decaf start ups? Here we are!|😘😘😘🌹🌹🌹🇱🇷|and why is that news|Liking caffeine isn’t a substitute for a personality|Why are people so easily offended over petty garbage!

79,,,"Lake Erie just won the same legal rights as people.

Citizens of Toledo Ohio voted this week on a very unusual question: Should Lake Erie be granted the legal rights normally reserved for a person?

The groundbreaking legislation passed easily which means people will be allowed to sue on behalf of the lake whenever it’s being polluted or in danger of other major environmental harm.

The law is part of the budding rights of nature movement which has notched several victories in the past dozen years. Rivers and forests have already won legal rights in countries like Ecuador Colombia India and New Zealand. Follow the link in our bio to learn more.

Three freshmen Congresswomen on the committee Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan made waves with their tough questioning of Cohen. The three new Congresswomen all took office in January after winning election in November 2018.

81,,,"If any Democratic presidential candidate has tapped into the Silicon Valley zeitgeist over their careers it is Cory Booker.

Booker raised half a million dollars from the internet industry over his five years in the Senate from people like LinkedIn’s Hoffman Salesforce’s Marc Benioff Google’s Eric Schmidt Emerson Collective founder Laurene Powell Jobs and early Facebook exec Sean Parker. But times have changed and Silicon Valley is no longer merely an ATM for Cory Booker.

Silicon Valley is itself a minefield that sums up the broader political challenge for Booker in 2020: He's running as a liberal on issues like tech regulation but the progressive left holds him in suspicion — and he could face more as he begins to court tech money.

Booker's tightrope walk needs to capitalize on his decades of coziness with tech elites and corporate America while not offending the liberal base that has them in its crosshairs. Visit recode.net to read the full story.

85,,,Justin Zanders 19 was walking down a San Francisco sidewalk in July 2016 when a pole hanging off the back of a city bus hit him in the face. Zanders was taken to Zuckerberg San Francisco General where he received stitches and a CT scan. He had insurance and only spent about four hours at the hospital — but he was hit was a $27660 bill. For years Zuckerberg General — the largest public hospital in San Francisco and the city’s only Level I trauma center — has been out of network with all private insurance plans a practice that experts say is extremely unusual. As a result patients are routinely hit with surprise bills that can top tens of thousands of dollars even when the same care would likely cost them significantly less at other hospitals.

94,,,"Former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson published a new book Merchants of Truth about the state of digital news and what she considers declining journalistic standards. It makes some good arguments. It could have been great. Instead it’s been engulfed in controversy over factual errors and charges of plagiarism.

The irony is impossible to miss: a book that discusses journalistic ethics praises legacy media (like the Times) and lambasts newer companies like Vice for sloppy reporting is well filled with errors and what appears to be very sloppy reporting. Vox’s Sean Illing asked Abramson to respond to the charges.

95,,,On Thursday Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey introduced the Green New Deal: an ambitious plan to make the United States carbon neutral by 2030 and turn the country into a global leader in renewable energy. The Green New Deal is fundamentally about making climate change a central Democratic priority in 2020 — without shoving aside health care and the economy. While Democrats have talked about climate change as the most important issue out there for some time there has been seemingly little urgency in Congress to take action. This proposal could mark a shift.

With one exception: The yellow first-down line. Since the late 1990s the virtual yellow line has been enhancing football broadcasts by giving viewers a live intuitive guide to the state of play.

The reports claiming it to be effective in Australia say that firearm violence is going down. But the thing is firearm was already going down before the ban. After the ban it continued to go down at the same steady rate there was no noticeable shard decrease. In reality the ban changed nothing. Well nothing positively there was some negative changes. For one since people couldn’t protect themselves anymore in Victoria the most populated state in Australia “In the last five years the number of recorded offences of Crimes against the person has continued to rise and increased by 20.5% or 13671 offences since the year ending June 2014. In this same period Assault and related offences increased by 15.7% (5889 offences) Sexual Offences increased by 42.5% (4454 offences) Dangerous and negligent acts endangering people increased by 40.0% (1676 offences) and Stalking harassment and threatening behaviour increased by 9.3% (999 offences).” These increases are no coincidence. Also the ban was did a horrible job at banning. Because “Australia’s national arsenal of private guns is larger than before the subsequent introduction of strict gun control laws” according to the University of Sydney. And none of these guns are owned legally.

121,,,"#OnThisDay in 1973 the Supreme Court issued the landmark decision Roe v. Wade which affirmed the constitutional right for women to access safe and legal abortions. It set off celebrations from reproductive rights activists but also protests from the pro-life movement such as the group pictured above demonstrating at the Minnesota Capitol building the day of the ruling.

46 years later the potential deciding vote to overturn Roe v. Wade sits on the Supreme Court. A wave of strict anti-abortion laws are passing in several states. And in the midst of a government shutdown Republicans put forth a bill to shore up restrictions on federal funding for abortion. (It failed).

Secondly I believe in foreign aid but I don't do not in any way believe that foreign aid should be a countries only focus, because that would be idiotic. Now you've said that fencing won't work, however you just said that the fence in California works perfectly as planned? The deficit scares, make no mistake, and adding 5 billion to it will not help, the government I do believe needs to look at how it's spending it's money, and needs to consider alternative revenue streams,  aka a passive income for the government. Crime is low no matter what you say , and it's not only CNN saying that, Vox is too, just joking its a fact. The only thing that is high is your fear of illegal immigrant crime, this is irrational behaviour that borders on fear mongering. I'm glad you see the benefits of legal immigration. Your example of immigrant crime is troubling however that doesn't mean that immigrant is dangerous, only a small number and to take opportunity from innocent people because someone looks the same as them is ridiculous, do some vetting if you feel the need turn people away, use advanced technology to prevent dangerous immigrants but do not hurt innocent and disenfranchised people who only want a better life. Also the world is a globe and people for various reasons usually illegally , and that can be a problem, but a wall won't fix it because when people are willing to cross continents there not gonna stop at the wall and say ""well we had a good try, better turn around"" no they are going to reach their for better oppurtunities, the only to solve the problem is by investing in the world to make it a Breyer place, aka foreign aid. Lastly you said im the kind of person that does nothing but I fight for what I believe in and I volunteer like hell, just dk you know. Also I've really enjoyed this back and forth.",1758

132,,,"When Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) announced her intent to run in the 2020 presidential race a few days ago she didn’t get the marquee treatment she would have predicted.

Gabbard initially excited the left because she was an outspoken economic progressive and a veteran who objected to American intervention abroad. She was also the first Hindu member of Congress and Nancy Pelosi once called her an “emerging star.” But more recently she’s taken positions that shocked her allies: She demanded that Barack Obama use the term “radical Islam.” She was the member of Congress most willing to advocate for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. And she was found to have ties to anti-LGBTQ groups and anti-Muslim Hindu nationalists.

142,,,"Scientists say that Joshua Trees could go extinct to climate change by 2100. The government shutdown is making things even worse. 
With the trees’ namesake national park unmanaged during the shutdown visitors are creating illegal roads and driving into some of the park’s most fragile areas. They are also chopping down trees setting illegal fires and graffitiing rocks. The eight on-duty law enforcement rangers have had no way to stop all the prohibited activity given that the park is roughly the size of Delaware — meaning vandals have been able to get away with accelerating the trees’ demise.

143,,,"When TL Coleman and her husband were furloughed during the 2013 government shutdown she said the financial consequences didn’t just impact her family. It impacted their nanny who they couldn’t afford to pay; the nanny’s parents who the nanny had to borrow funds from and so on. It set off a financial chain reaction.

That’s because as Coleman writes on our site this week federal workers aren’t the only people who feel the pain of bipartisan disagreements: “It is our families our communities and those who rely on our salaries to make their own ends meet … such as child care workers cab drivers and restaurant workers.” At the link in bio find her full essay about the hardships she faced during that experience — and how she now prepares for the worst. #governmentshutdown",governmentshutdown,|@voxdotcom subscribe to pewdiepie|Hmm I wonder where that perception has come from.

144,,,"A key argument President Trump made in his primetime speech Tuesday night is similar to one he’s used before in press conferences and on Twitter: that Mexico will end up paying for the border wall through the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) the trilateral trade deal that’s an updated version of NAFTA. 
But those claims just don’t add up. For starters the deal hasn’t yet been ratified and second experts agree that once it is it won’t be a major revenue stream for the US.

My logic according to google the lowest minimum wage job is as fallows Kansas had the lowest legislated non-tipped worker minimum wage in the U.S. $2.65 per hour until it was raised to $7.25 effective January 1 2010.

146,,,"California Massachusetts and other states are taking a straightforward approach to fighting the opioid epidemic: treating addiction like any other medical condition.

If done right this idea — which would allow patients to seek treatment at the doctor’s office or hospital — could dramatically expand access to addiction treatment across the US. It would reduce the need to rely on expensive infrequent and siloed addiction treatment facilities. It would mean patients could pay with health insurance making treatment much more affordable. And the medication they use would be viewed not as a crutch (as buprenorphine often is today) but as akin to insulin or aspirin. And finally relapse wouldn’t be treated as a moral failure but a normal part of recovery.

German Lopez traveled to Sacramento to see firsthand what it looks like when addiction is treated this way. Read his report at the link in our bio.

148,,,"When Nina Dang 24 fell off her bike last year a bystander called an ambulance that took her to the emergency room at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Doctors X-rayed her arm and took some CT scans. She left with her arm in a splint on pain medication and with a recommendation to follow up with an orthopedist.

A few months later she got a bill for $24074.50. Her health insurer would only cover $3830.79 — an amount that it thought was fair for the services.

Dang’s situation isn’t unique. Vox reviewed five patient bills from that specific hospital’s ER in consultation with medical billing experts and found that Zuckerberg San Francisco General’s billing can cost privately insured patients tens of thousands of dollars for care that would likely cost them far less at other hospitals.

150,,,"The opening of the #116thCongress Thursday set up a striking visual moment in the House of Representatives: On Democrats’ side of the aisle a historically diverse class of women and people of color were clad in bright outfits as they were sworn in while on the Republican side a relatively homogeneous group of mostly white men wore nearly identical dark suits.
The contrast underlined the stark differences between how the two parties have approached promoting women and candidates of color which was very apparent during the 2018 midterm elections (Republicans actually saw declines in their number of women representatives though the number of GOP women did grow in the Senate).

If seeing other groups represented makes you feel attacked it is because deep down you’re scared your privilege will be compromised. It means you’re not as “superior” as you’ve been led to believe for centuries. It means you and the Muslim Black Hispanic et al - neighbor you have is your equal and you can’t stand the idea.

So if we want to win democrats need to start talking to white people better. Those are just the facts. Don't get angry. I'm just saying the democratic congress depicted in this photo does not look representational of this country. It looks like it's increasingly becoming the party of minorities.

164,,,"In Denmark new moms have 14 weeks off after a baby is born. Dads have two weeks off and then there are nearly eight months that parents decide how to split. Most Danish employers give their workers their full salary for part of that time and for the rest of it the Danish government gives a stipend.

To progressives in the US it sounds like a socialist paradise. But the problem is in the averages: Danish mothers take 10 months of parental leave while Dads take only one. And that gap has consequences for Danes at work and at home.

177,,,This year dozens of Democratic candidates ran — and won — on a promise to fight to give all Americans access to government-run health care. “Medicare-for-all” has become a rallying cry on the left but the term doesn’t capture the full scope of options Democrats are considering to insure all (or at least a lot more) Americans.

Six months later Bush enlisted into the #USNavy  immediately after he graduated from Phillips Academy on his eighteenth birthday. He became a naval aviator taking training for aircraft carrier operations aboard USS Sable. After completing the 10-month course he was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Naval Reserve at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on June 9 1943 (just three days before his 19th birthday) which made him the youngest naval aviator to that date.
In September 1943 he was assigned to Torpedo Squadron 51 (VT-51) as the photographic officer.The following year his squadron was based in #USS San Jacinto as a member of Air Group 51 where his lanky physique earned him the nickname ""Skin"".During this time the task force was victorious in one of the largest air battles of World War II: the Battle of the #Philippine Sea.|After #Bush's promotion to lieutenant (junior grade) on August 1 1944 San Jacinto commenced operations against the Japanese in the #BoninIslands. #Bush piloted one of four #Grumman #TBM Avengers of VT-51 that attacked the Japanese installations on #Chichijima. His crew for the mission which occurred on September 2 1944 included Radioman Second Class John Delaney and Lt.(jg) William White. During their attack the Avengers encountered intense anti-aircraft fire; Bush's aircraft was hit by flak and his engine caught fire. Despite the fire in his aircraft Bush completed his attack and released bombs over his target scoring several damaging hits. With his engine ablaze Bush flew several miles from the island where he and one other crew member of the TBM bailed out; the other man's parachute did not open. Bush waited for four hours in an inflated raft while several fighters circled protectively overhead until he was rescued by the submarine #USS Finback on lifeguard duty. For the next month he remained in Finback and participated in the rescue of other aviators. Several of those shot down during the attack were executed and their livers were eaten by their captors. A radio operator from the Japanese unit that shot down Bush plane was American citizen Nobuaki Iwatake a Japanese American who had settled in Japan six months before Pearl Harbor and was drafted into the Japanese Imperial Army in 1943. This experience shaped Bush profoundly leading him to ask ""Why had I been spared and what did God have for me?""|In November 1944 #Bush returned to #SanJacinto and participated in operations in the Philippines until his squadron was replaced and sent home to the #UnitedStates. Through 1944 he flew 58 combat missions for which he received the #Distinguished Flying Cross three #Air Medals and the #Presidential Unit Citationawarded to San Jacinto. Bush was then reassigned to a training wing for torpedo bomber crews at #Norfolk Navy Base Virginia. His final assignment was to a new torpedo squadron VT-153 based at #Naval Air Station Grosse Ile Michigan. Bush was #honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy in September 1945 one month after the surrender of Japan.|🇺🇸🙏🏽❤️",4717

200,,,"Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen struck a plea deal with Robert Mueller on Thursday. 
The documents tell us that Trump’s business tried to work with the Russian government to build Trump Tower Moscow while he was running for president — and Trump was not only aware of it but concealed it from the public. Cohen who pleaded guilty to lying about this in the past will reportedly now provide investigators with “dozens of hours of testimony” that could be potentially damaging for the president.

202,,,"Cannabidiol — or CBD — is having a moment. Increasingly common state legalization and loose federal regulation means that anyone in any state can go online or to a physical store and buy CBD products from beauty products to dog treats without fear of arrest. The substance has been shown to help treat a number of conditions including anxiety.

Here’s the catch: Most of the products on the market are poorly labeled and have extremely low doses — which means they may not be effective at all.

Many New Yorkers aren’t convinced the new HQ will bring the jobs promised to the area and worry that instead that their city will foot a massive bill.

You will be missed 😢|😭💔|#finally|Stan “The Man” Lee had a dream since he began writing in his early teens. Stan wanted to write the great American novel. He wanted to pen a story of literary excellence a spectacular tale that all Americans could relate to. According to Lee himself he never got to write that book. Instead Stan wrote for Marvel Comics. However his well-crafted stories of love tragedy war monsters and heroes have forever become a part of American culture and are recognizable around the world. Stan Lee is considered by many to be the co-creator of not just a few comic books but of modern American pop-culture. But he grew to be much more than that. Stan Lee was America's grandfather telling ageless and relatable stories to all of us and insisting on forgetting formalities so we could gather around and have a good time. Through his incredible myths he taught us powerful lessons about life and responsibility. Stan's epics comforted us in times of despair gave us motivation in times of doubt and inspired many to follow their own dreams. Whether it was talking to that girl next door writing our own fables or becoming a real hero Stan's marvelous adventures gave us the courage to stand up and face our own fears. Now while he may be gone his memory lives in all of us and his ever popular amazing fantasies. Face front true believers. For Stan let's move ever upward (excelsior)!|@jazdauskaite|🥺|Thanks for all the joy in our lives... RIP..|Ahh @jmnelson90 😭😭 !

The Camp Fire pictured above has torched more than 70000 acres and thousands of buildings since igniting Thursday morning.

231,,,"“I’m so fucking proud of you guys” Beto O’Rourke said to his campaign team in an impassioned concession speech Tuesday night. 
O’Rourke ultimately couldn’t unseat Ted Cruz but the race for Texas’s Senate seat was still shockingly close for one that’s been comfortably handed to Republicans for the past 30-odd years. And the amount of energy behind the Democratic candidate has made the GOP nervous that O’Rourke could still be a big winner by inspiring a blue wave across the state.

And we’ve already seen signs of that happening — like Democrats unseating 11-term Republican Pete Sessions in the state’s 32nd District.

I believe that I am an original feminist. Not because I’m old, but because I just believe in the principles of original feminism. I think original feminism was about certain basic rights, basic human equality — the ability for women to vote, to get any job for which they were qualified, to make decisions about marriage and childrearing for themselves, I believe in all of these things.
But that’s first-wave feminism. Then came the radicals. Feminism moved from being about achieving equal rights for women to something different. Instead, feminism was turned into a fight over three chief ideas: Number 1. Men and women are absolutely identical. Not they have equal rights. Not they should be treated with equal opportunity, but they are absolutely identical. There are no differences between men and women. Second, that the patriarchy, every institution of American society … are reflective of an evil patriarchal system. And finally, we need a new standard; we need new mores, to replace the old patriarchal system.",1016

To figure this out we looked at the average summer high and winter low temperatures in 1000 US cities in the lower 48 states comparing recorded and modeled temperatures from 1986-2015 to projections for 2036-2065. This offers us a good estimate on how much winters and summers will shift from 2000 to 2050. The big takeaway: Warming is happening faster the farther north you go in the US. The weather (and precipitation) in several Northern cities will look and feel a lot like how Southern cities do today. In some cities it’ll be like moving two states south.

265,,,Recent revelations about journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance have threatened America’s relationship with Saudi Arabia. Lawmakers have called for a break in the alliance but Trump and members of his administration continue to back Riyadh (in part they say because they don’t want to jeopardize billions of Saudi dollars flowing into the US economy). Another reason is that the bond with the Kingdom goes way way back — here’s a photo of Franklin D. Roosevelt with Saudi King Ibn Saud in 1945.

In a primary you choose between a RINO and a conservative.  In the general election you only have the choice between Democrats and Republicans.  If you do not vote for any and all Republicans you are giving the seat to a Democrat.  It is called the lesser of two evils in the case of a RINO.  Be smart hold your nose and vote for every Republican or the Democrats will make life truly miserable for all of us.  The Democrats have been bought and paid for entirely by leftist who want a one-world government controlled by the very rich.  Yes some Republicans have also been bought but at least the current Republican leader is President Trump.  Finally we have a leader who loves and is trying to save America.

Long before Brett Kavanaugh had ever been nominated for the Court some argued that something like that couldn’t possibly happen again.

It just did — and before during and after Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote Saturday Americans showed up outside the Capitol and the Supreme Court to protest for this very reason. It’s not likely those demonstrations will end anytime soon. 
The effects of this vote will reverberate for decades.

To deny this you are admitting unfamiliarity with how legal counsel works. What you are seeing is not Ford’s personality but her lawyers speaking through her; lawyers who have been scouted by the Democratic Party.
.
Regardless of the validity of her story denying the fact that she is being used as a political pawn is asinine.
.
Why is no-one talking about the holes and inconsistencies in Ford’s story? Her selective memory seems to work entirely in her favor. It not only leaves many questions unanswered but makes potential key witnesses unobtainable. Why are the therapist’s notes inconsistent with Ford’s testimony? 
HER LAWYERS REFUSE TO RELEASE the notes claiming invasion of privacy - which is standard legal objection procedure for hiding key evidence. This refusal comes as a stark contrast to the pretense of full transparency she has feigned to the public.
.
Additionally she only showed “select portions” of these notes to the Washington Post
Why? What does she have to hide?
Her lawyers know Kavanaugh will never agree to the FBI investigations which not only incredibly invasive in nature will cause sufficient delay to the confirmation process holding a vacant seat until the midterm elections happen.
With this her lawyers rest assured her therapist’s notes which may contradict her testimony will never see sunlight.

The cause was a massive coastal earthquake. Earthquakes in the ocean can trigger tsunamis as vertical underwater movements shift columns of water causing massive waves to propagate. These waves can travel upward of 500 miles per hour in the deep ocean. As they roar toward coastal waters the waves slow down while getting taller. 
Beyond its catastrophic strength part of what made this particular event so devastating was how little warning there was — locals reported that sirens didn’t go off text message alerts failed to send and the country’s tsunami warning may have been lifted too soon.

Nor would I lie and say I did it and I was sorry just to appease the public either. The only thing a honest and innocent person could say is I can’t remember anything like that ever happening and I’m more than happy to take a lie detector test and cooperate in anyway other ways I can.

I don’t know how I got there or how I got home over 8 miles away (at the age of 15). My life time friend doesn’t remember any of this ( and the other 3 people I said were there testified under oath they don’t know anything about this). I have a fear of flying  but have no problem jet-setting all over the world while on vacation. I’ve been on airplanes more in the past two months than most people in a year but my fear is completely legit.

I don’t know who paid for my hotel and polygraph test( the afternoon of my grandmothers funeral or maybe it was the next day who knows). And guess what? I flew there. Oh and that polygraph it was only two questions neither of which were about Kavanaugh. But hey I passed so that’s all that matters. And my PhD in psychology definitely in no way helped me with it or my testimony today.

My friends on the beach encouraged me to continue contacting the media with my story (because we were running out of time). I can’t name them so we’ll just call them beach friends. Yet while giving such great advice none were willing to be character witnesses. Meanwhile Judge Kavanaugh had hundreds of character witnesses step up in a matter of days.

My lawyers out of the kindness of their hearts are helping me for FREE yet I have a “needed” gofundme page that currently is sitting at $473622. I’m so desperately in need of help there’s even a second gofundme with $209987. I promise though I’m not getting anything out of my testimony that money is just going to cover my expenses.

I’m super smart. I have a PhD and I teach graduate students. I know lots of big words but it should be totally believable that I don’t understand basic questions.

I was the only person in the United States that didn’t know Congress agreed to come to me instead of me going to DC. They really do care about my flying phobia after all.

How can you watch her testify and not believe her?|The amendments applicable to criminal court cannot convict someone without evidence. A he said-she said case with no confession is simply invalid. The burden of PROOF is finding a defendant guilty or not guilty beyond reasonable doubt. These cases that occurred decades ago are not appropriate for the criminal court. Judicially nothing can be done. If she wants to come forward with her story and trauma then yes of course that is brave but this hearing needs to be the end of it. The only reason Bill Cosby was convicted was because of his confession. Without one there is no logical reason to bring legislative or judiciary representatives into this. Good for her but we must not believe that someone is undoubtably guilty without considering the burden of proof in court or out of it.|It takes someone so strong to do what she did|She. Is.

300,,,One of President Trump’s favorite attacks on his political opponents is to say that the world is “laughing” at the US. But on Tuesday after he said that “we have accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country” the assembled world notables at the UN General Assembly literally laughed at *him.” Past American presidents were not met with this kind of derision. That's not surprising: Pew data shows that trust in the US around the world plummeted after Trump took office. While Trump may be able to get away with this kind of absurd bragging at home — putting his presidency at the same level as Washington's Lincoln's and FDR's — world dignitaries have more critical distance and no political incentive to let him get away with hyperbole.

302,,,Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation process has brought to the surface many myths our culture repeats about rape and other sexual misconduct: that committing sexual violence is normal male behavior (boys will be boys after all); that real victims come forward right away (and anyone who waits must be a liar); that depriving someone of a powerful position is the same as locking him in prison (or even killing him); that it takes the word of multiple women (at least more than one and probably more than two) to equal the worth of a man’s word; and that the country owes accused men a path to redemption (even if they haven’t acknowledged what they did wrong). And as the one-year anniversary of the #MeToo movement approaches what happens to him will show if anything at all has really changed.

He indicted him on 25 charges in three separate batches and across two venues. In the first trial stemming from his probe his team got Manafort convicted on eight counts. 
Mueller has been seeking this moment for nearly a year. Now that he’s got it what’s next?

330,,,"Since the 80s Nike has used its marketing to challenge the status quo — to say to be a beast on the basketball court not a role model for anyone’s kids. It’s said to let girls play sports and make room for observant Muslim women athletes. In 1987 it even used a song by the Beatles to praise nonconformity.

And in 2018 the brand is taking a stand alongside Colin Kaepernick.

The new ad has caused shock waves including protests. But the company has focused its expansion in major cities where young diverse shoppers live — a demographic that’s the least likely to have voted for Trump and most likely to support Kaepernick and the Black Lives Matter movement. That means the threats from the president and others aren’t a problem for Nike. They’re a bonus.

It might be unfair but woman with kids Want more flexible hours which correlates with salary.

You might notice that it’s… overwhelmingly white. Past group photos like this one under President Trump have drawn criticism for that very characteristic: the summer 2017 class was very white and male; the fall 2017 picture featured an intern making a white power gesture (though he denied it) and the spring 2018 class was about the same though there were more female interns represented.

This season the White House didn’t release the photo at all — Vox obtained this copy.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) Our Revolution and Democracy for America in the primary. He has proposed hiking the state’s corporate tax rate to fund education raising its minimum wage to $15 and endorsed a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system at the national level. He also supports expanding Medicaid under Obamacare and has joined other progressives who want to abolish the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency after the family separations crisis.

There is an ongoing FBI investigation into corruption in the Tallahassee city government — though Gillum has not been implicated in any way according to the Tampa Bay Times.

She’s denied the allegations but the news has sent shockwaves through the movement as advocates come to terms with the fact that a high-profile survivor of sexual misconduct might also be a perpetrator. 
Disturbing as they are the allegations against Argento are a reminder of a bigger issue that American society still needs to reckon with: Too often survivors of sexual misconduct have to be “perfect victims” in order to be believed. 
But survivors of sexual assault aren’t paragons of perfection — they’re people. 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men has experienced rape or attempted rape. Some of them are people who have themselves done terrible things including assault others.

355,,,"Tuesday August 21 2018 is a day that will live in the minds and hearts of American journalists news junkies and politics nerds for years to come.

In very rapid succession the day saw two major Trump associates — Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen — found guilty of very serious crimes in federal court. It saw another aide Larry Kudlow facing accusations that he palled around with a prominent white nationalist. It saw a major Trump ally in Congress indicted for spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign money on personal expenses. And it ended with Trump giving a speech in Charleston that turned into a mess of digressions and threats to unravel NATO.

She held the record for the most-charted female artist in Billboard history for nearly 40 years with 73 titles in the Hot 100. Her first Hot 100 song “Won’t Be Long” debuted when Franklin was just 18 years old in 1961. She also racked up 18 Grammy Awards over the course of her career and in 1987 she was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. “What distinguishes her is not merely the breadth of her catalogue or the cataract force of her vocal instrument” wrote David Remnick in the New Yorker in 2016; “it’s her musical intelligence her way of singing behind the beat of spraying a wash of notes over a single word or syllable of constructing moment by moment the emotional power of a three-minute song.” Read more about the extraordinary legacy she leaves behind on Vox.com. #Aretha #ArethaFranklin,aretha arethafranklin,|F|😢|Legends never dies|Full disclosure: I wasn’t aware she was actually still alive.

According to the Census Bureau 2013 was the first year that a majority of US infants under the age of 1 were nonwhite. By 2030 immigration will overtake new births as the dominant driver of population growth. And 15 years after that for the first time in the nation’s history non-Hispanic whites will no longer make up a majority of the population. Gender dynamics are also in flux.

388,,,"Despite her #Wimbledon loss at age 36 and 10 months after giving birth @SerenaWilliams is still playing excellent tennis. And that excellence is all the more remarkable because we know it’s been hard fought: in the months since her daughter was born she’s been open about the effort it’s taken to recover from childbirth and return to athletic form — as well as the time with her daughter that she’s had to miss to accommodate her training schedule. 
So at first glance Serena Williams a celebrity with a huge house and hefty paycheck is the least relatable working mother in history. But her willingness to discuss the challenges sends an important message: being a working parent is hard. And if the greatest tennis player of all time can admit it so should all of us.

390,,,"Peter Strzok the FBI agent whose anti-Trump text messages raised concerns that the Mueller investigation was tainted by political bias faced questions from Congress Thursday. And things quickly got heated.

In what Vox’s Zeeshan Aleem described as a “full-on partisan circus” Rep. Trey Gowdy at one point told Strzok that he didn’t “appreciate having an FBI agent with an unprecedented level of animus working on two major investigations during 2016.” Strozk didn’t take that well — and launched into a passionate defense of the agency. 
The stakes are high: if that defense is received well by the public he could potentially deal a serious blow to the power of right-wing narratives about FBI corruption. But if not it could do damage to the credibility of the Mueller probe.

When you look at a map Hong Kong looks like it belongs to China. And it does — kind of. It has its own government its own economic system its own currency even its own Olympic team. Yet the physical border between the two countries is set to formally expire in 29 years. What will that mean for the Hong Kongers who have built such a unique identity?

In facts Hong Kong was a colony of British in Qing dynasty of China but Qing was ended in 1910s. 
During first of 20 century Communist Party (Later People’s Republic of China) and Nationalist Party China (Republic of China or now Taiwan) had a civil war. I think the dynasty and times changed made some confuse of identity to Hong Konger. 
When Hong Kong ‘returned’ to China there was controlled by a small group of people and Hong Konger has no idea about there identity before 1997.
After 1997 the conflict between Hong Kong and China was appeared so it increased the sense of belonging of Hong Konger.
Hong Kong has own currency economy legal system and language (Cantonese and traditional chinese words not Mandarin and simplified chinese words) these factors are make me think as I am Hong Konger but not a Chinese.

392,,,"President Trump has chosen Brett Kavanaugh a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. 
He’s a veteran of every conservative fight from the Clinton impeachment to the battle against Obamacare and would almost certainly enable a rightward shift in the Court’s jurisprudence for decades to come. Even more concerning for liberals he’s suggested enhancing the president’s power to block criminal and civil actions against him — which is worrisome when the president is facing multiple lawsuits.

The mission to rescue them has been an extraordinary international operation with hundreds of cave and rescue experts and military personnel from different countries including the United States pitching in. Rescue divers first delivered food and an air tube to the boys to make sure they had enough oxygen to breathe. They’ve since taught them to dive and have been escorting them out of the cave along this path one by one. Doctors have also been providing medical assistance.

And blue is the Democrat’s traditional hue. Pair those colors with bold type and Spanish exclamation points and you have branding as radical as her policies.

400,,,"While on vacation in San Franciso in 2016 Jang Yeo-im’s eight-month-old son fell off a hotel bed and hit his head. There was no blood but the baby was inconsolable. Jang and her husband called 911 and an ambulance took the family — tourists from South Korea — to a local hospital.

Doctors said the baby was fine; he took a short nap in his mother’s arms drank some infant formula and was discharged with a clean bill of health. 
Two years later the bill arrived: they owed the hospital $18836 for the 3-hour visit.

She paired the dress with Queen Mary’s diamond bandeau tiara.

The bouquet was designed by florist Philippa Craddock with the help of some blooms hand-picked from the royal family’s private garden by Prince Harry. In included Forget-Me-Nots Princess Diana’s favorite flower.

After a few days of conflicting reports Markle’s father ultimately did not attend the wedding. (Her mother Doria Ragland did). She instead asked her father-in-law Prince Charles to escort her down the aisle. 
The couple was not shy to make the point that she just became one of the first mixed-race members of the British royal family.

What followed is the kind of story that’s been told thousands of times as America’s opioid epidemic grows: Her casual use of opioid painkillers over time turned into full-blown addiction.

But last year she got on buprenorphine (also known as Suboxone) which doesn’t produce a euphoric high when taken as prescribed. She said that the drug paired with therapy helps her treat the withdrawal; she’s also seeing a chiropractor to treat the pain that led her to use opioid painkillers in the first place. Her treatment is paid for through Medicaid.

Ricciuti’s story show that the opioid crisis and addiction are not insurmountable. But America hasn’t fully embraced the solutions like this one that we know can work.

We are all whether we like it or not a slave to something. Being liberated from that indoctrination is so complicated because we don't even understand how we're programmed. The powers that be do not want us thinking freely thinking critically.

There must be discussion.|Kudos to Starbucks for addressing the issue quickly and its commitment to racial equality.|I think one of the big things people are not realizing about this situation is where this happened - center city Philadelphia where there is a seriously high population of homeless people. Businesses all throughout the city enforce rules like this to ward off the homeless to protect their businesses and customers. Now I don't believe that either of the men that were arrested appeared in any way to be homeless but I know that in the city (I live in the suburbs of Philadelphia) policies like the one that the manager was enforcing are common. In this particular case I think that the manager calling the police was unnecessary and I think that the arrest was beyond inappropriate. However I do not think that the policy itself in inherently racist though I do think that the manager's choice to call the police on two black men was - I doubt that she would have done the same of it had been two white men. The fact that Starbucks is going on an apology tour of sorts and the fact that so many people feel it is necessary seems like a bit of an overreaction. However I wish we heard more from the men who were arrested. Do they feel Starbucks as an institution is to blame? Do they feel the manager and then the police by default overreacted? I wish I knew.

470,,,"Last October Bradley Sroka took his 1-year-old daughter Margot to the local emergency room after she managed to tie a piece of her own blonde hair around her toe causing it to swell. Margot turned out to be fine — a physician assistant inspected her toe and applied an antibacterial ointment.

A month later the Sroka family got a $937.25 for the 29-minute visit. 
This fits an American pattern: Worried parents take their children to the emergency room because their pediatrician’s office is closed often on nights or weekends. When treated for relatively basic medical care the parents receive shockingly hefty bills that typically leave a burden on their household.

To mark the founder’s appearance in DC activists from the group Avaaz placed 100 cardboard cutouts Zuckerberg outside the Capitol — with hopes of calling attention to what they say are millions of fake accounts spreading misinformation on the social network.

475,,,"The US has long done a poor job tracking killings by cops making them difficult to study. So we (along with John Roman a senior fellow at NORC at the University of Chicago) did some research ourselves.

Our results suggest that weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun ownership do at the very least correlate with more killings by police officers (including shootings and other incidents of lethal force). America has to address a whole host of issues to bring down its levels of police killings. But it also may be time to start thinking of these killings as inherently linked to America’s overall gun problem.

Let’s get one thing out of the way: Hicks’s modeling career spanned five years as a teen from age 11 to 16. And it was part-time. Yet the New York Times Washington Post NBC Fox BBC and more have made sure to mention her modeling past in their reports.

In the long line of men who’ve left the West Wing no outlet has highlighted their part-time jobs or activities in high school. That wouldn’t be relevant. And it’s not for Hicks either.

Childbirth and child rearing is a complex issue and as primary caregiver you either have to raise the child on your own or leave the kid at a daycare or with a nanny so there's no guarantee what the child will learn in it's primary years. The point is women are pressured into feeling that they are incomplete without kids..so even if they excel at work or in academics family and friends will guilt trip them on the ""you need a man/you need a kid"" topic.

Every human should have access to the ability to kill others easily - is that what freedom comes down to?|These statements bring up so many more politics! If a teacher is risking their life everyday at school just as police officers and firefighters are then they should be earning as much!|@debharshi : this could be a good discussion|As a teacher I don’t wake up fearing my life everyday. Just saying. Work dangers are associated with every job. Would be nice if a raise would take place.... we are still trained to handle these situations but don’t get paid for the training.|The big issue here comes from people thinking that a world where no one has guns or the knowledge to use them is a safe place. What we need is armed guards in every school. Most schools have them already in the US don't they? You people forget what survival of the fittest is about. We have to be capable of fighting for our lives if necessary in this case there should be trained people to fight for other's lives.|I could not even imagine the pressure of just wanting to be an educator but knowing that you know have a responsibility to kill somebody who wants to kill your students... that should not be a reality. You don't get into a boat with a hole and decide to fix it when you're out on the water . You fix the hole first. Keeping guns out of the hands of people who want to do harm should be priority  not arming people to protect against those people . Christ.

521,,,"Fox & Friends airs a toxic mix of internet conspiracy theories right-wing propaganda and general absurdity. But it’s now one of the most influential news shows in the US because it has a direct line to the White House.

525,,,"Did Ram read Martin Luther King’s whole sermon before airing its Super Bowl commercial? 
If it had the brand would know that economic inequality was a facet of capitalism that King openly took issue with particularly in the speech that (partially) played during its commercial for pickup trucks. Delivered February 4 1968 King’s “Drum Major Instinct” sermon was in part an examination and takedown of “a desire to be out front a desire to lead the parade a desire to be first” when it comes to monetary possessions. Which means: it literally discourages people from spending too much money on cars. 
That Ram used King’s words in an advertisement for trucks — during a tentpole capitalistic event marking the tail-end of an NFL season in which racial protest was a key element — is an irony that cannot be understated.

They did it “to unite against any attempts … to roll back the incredible progress women have made in the last century” said Rep. Lois Frankel (D-FL) who chairs the coalition. 
This year Frankel says “our fears have come true.” The administration rolled back the Obama-era birth control mandate. It’s chipping away at Medicaid which covers half of all US births. And there are multiple allegations of sexual misconduct on Capitol Hill. 
Frankel and her Democratic colleagues in Congress wore black to the State of the Union Tuesday evening to show solidarity with women across the country who are standing up against sexual harassment.

When Martyl Langsdorf designed the Doomsday Clock in 1947 it was just an arbitrary graphic for the first edition of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists magazine. But over time it became ongoing symbol for their interpretation of humanity’s approach toward the end of times. The Bulletin originally only changed the clock when they felt the threat of nuclear weapons became more or less imminent — but today the clock reflects other types of threats as well from climate change to cybersecurity to reckless language to… Donald Trump.

533,,,"“I have signed your death warrant.” That’s what Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said to former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar on Wednesday as she sentenced him to 40 to 175 years in prison for criminal sexual assault. That’s on top of a separate 60-year sentence for child pornography.

While Judge Aquilina was praised for her compassion towards victims throughout the hearing she’s also been heavily criticized for her strong words against the defendant. Many particularly in the legal community feel she crossed an ethical line.

On our site today a public defender makes the case for the latter argument (which you can read via the link in our bio). But we want to hear from you: do you feel the judge overstepped her role? Tell us why or why not. #LarryNassar #gymnastics",larrynassar gymnastics,"|Talk to me about Brock Turner’s sentencing and the judge who oversaw his case and then we’ll discuss crossing a line.|Nobody ever speaks the truth whatever happens to him in prison was going to happen either way... 🤦🏽‍♀️|If she was a man they would praise her for being courageous.|Yes. If only because she made the story about herself instead of where it belongs on the victims.|Judge Aquulina is a literal goddess and let me tell you why: she heard the countless stories of the women and girls who were assaulted by this literal monster and not ONCE did she blame any of the victims for what that trash of a man did to them. She then rightfully handed it to Nassar without remorse giving him full justice and no human sympathy and empathy. #nobs! This man deserves no morality from anyone because he failed to show hundreds of females that basic respect for YEARS.|Absolutely not. They’re worried about feelings?! He assaulted over 100! Females. Known. Imagine those who did not step forward? GIVE ME A BREAK feelings.|Nope but the sexual assault charges against the coach showed HE crossed an ethical line.|She was absolutely in the right. If a judge can't pass judgement on monsters who can? Nassar is a garbage person who deserves every nasty word Judge Aquilina has for him.|Judges are humans not robots. Perhaps in the future AI will determine guilt or innocence as well as passing sentence. We do ask judges to be impartial during trial but should we for the sentencing phase? Don’t we want human standards to be applied? Judge Acquilina was trying to correct a systematic injustice (which allowed this perpetrator to continue in his role & have access to his victims). Isn’t that justice? Are we holding her to a higher standard because of a bias against women exhibiting power (yes the author of the article is a woman but unconscious bias is not limited to only people not like ourselves). #NasserSentencing|I agree with everything she has said - I just hope there aren’t any grounds for appeal based on her comments.|Yeah.

Judge Aquilina used her public platform in the best way she saw fit in order to bring justice x make an example out of that disgusting man.

In this case where the system failed so many victims the judge's elevation of the victims created a greater sense that justice was accomplished. It also seems an important distinction that this was the sentencing phase and not determination of guilt.|A sentence which has a maximum prison time of 235 years is “signing a death warrant”. Kudos to her for being blunt about it. Not the most eloquent choice of words but far from being a questionably ethical statement. If the legal community wants to debate this then I think their time is better served questioning some of the outdated common laws.|Is everyone just slamming vox before reading the actual article? It's written by a Bay Area public defender not a Vox staffer. It's just offering insight from a judicial perspective not a newsroom/editorial perspective.|Well i think life long sentences and death are unethical and uncalled for punishments no matter what.

We don't need any more quiet pansies thanks.|She absolutely did not cross the line. He deserves it.|I think if the judge was a man and handled himself the same way we’d be calling him a hero and champion of women. But it’s not and we want to debate - “did she overstep her boundaries?” (For a child molester of over 150 girls that writes a letter taking no responsibility?) Give me a break - I understand the legal obligation she has but we’re gonna let it slide this time because they spent days listening to the horrific first hand accounts and based on that it’s a miracle he’s managed to make it out of that courtroom alive. He’s scum. And he’s going to be housed and fed by taxpayers til he dies.|Who would ever criticize her? She was facing a sexual predator! ALL judges should be this way.|What ethical line? He was convicted and receiving his sentence. Did she give him more than she is allowed? Did she interfere with testimony in an unethical way? Judges have been known to make statements from the bench and do it after sentencing is complete. She stated a fact. That is all.|Too many times these people get off easy and I think the language is due to the frustration of a broken infrastructure. The infrastructure that allowed this to happen in the first place... @vox|The judge’s statement was blunt and factual. Not unethical given the duration of the sentence.

534,,,"The question of President Trump’s mental fitness has caused a rift in psychiatry where experts are now reconsidering the role of mental health professionals in public debates.

The answer relies on an interpretation of the 25th Amendment which was ratified after JFK’s assassination in 1963. It (attempted to) establish a process whereby the president could be removed or replaced in the event of death or incapacitation. One section notes that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet can declare the president unfit for office.

Yet they managed to pass a tax bill that will give about $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to corporations and the very wealthy. If you’re wondering how they paid for it They didn’t. The cost is piled onto the deficit. 
Since it began 20 years ago CHIP has dramatically reduced the number of kids who go without health insurance and increased their access to medical services all at a relatively low price.

It’s elevated the #MeToo movement and lately #TimesUp — the movement started by Hollywood to put an end to sexual abuse in the workplace. (And was the reason behind all those black dresses you saw at last weekend’s #GoldenGlobes). We’ve built a database to track the scale and scope of this issue throughout 2018. One reason we think it’s important to track accusations and not just people who have fallen due to allegations: Some power brokers only face consequences when multiple accusers come forward.

But we knew we were privileged to be able to return to our safe homes in the United States where we have access to electricity water and food. It’s been more than two months since Hurricane Maria and still most of the island lacks these bare necessities. 
Puerto Rico continues to suffer. What gives us hope is the optimism and resilience of the people we met who so graciously shared their stories. Puerto Ricans are surviving because neighbors are helping one another. We hope to return soon to continue telling this story. 
We would like to acknowledge the people of Puerto Rico who have died as a result of the storm the people trying to survive the people making the tough decision of whether to stay or uproot their lives and move to the United States the disaster responders trying to make things right and the local journalists working in an incredibly tough environment to shed light on such a devastating event.

While driving down Highway 901 we came across a line of about 1000 people waiting in the rain on the side of the road. They were seeking to register with FEMA for disaster assistance. Some said they’d been there since the previous night and no food or public restroom was available. FEMA had communicated very little information about this event to the public and the situation was turning chaotic. 
No officials on the scene would answer our questions that morning. But FEMA representatives later told me in an email the agency had registered 222 survivors that day and answered questions from “many others.” This was one of the most intense stories I’ve personally covered and a low point of the whole trip. We’d seen so many signs of progress throughout our 12 days there but to witness so many people — American citizens — desperate for help was sickening. @elaine_cromie explained it well afterward: “It felt like someone hit you in the gut.” I reached out to Rep. Nydia Velazquez a House Democrat who represents New York and is a native of Yabucoa for comment. She said the scene I described mirrored what her office had heard about the relief effort in other parts of the island. —Photo by @elaine_cromie caption by @__bybianca

The storm left their thriving barbershop without power and they didn't have money for a generator. Determined to keep their business running the duo moved outside and now use car batteries to power their equipment.

Like the Ortiz brothers many other business owners have shown great resilience in creating ways to keep their doors open or finding new means to make a living. For example we met a man named Luis Rodriguez on our way to another story. He previously sold plants and gardening supplies for a living but his materials were destroyed in the hurricane. He found a new way to earn money by selling washboards to people driving by on a road in Barranquitas. Now more than two months after the storm around 32% of the island still lacks power. Many restaurant owners are struggling and often have to decide between paying for gas for a generator to open their doors or shutting down completely until power is restored. —Photo and caption by @elaine_cromie.

.
Carlos hosts our popular #Strikethrough video series which breaks down the bizarre state of journalism in the Trump era — from the decline of the White House press briefing to white supremacists’ love for Tucker Carlson. His trick for keeping people hooked: throwing in lots of humor.
.
“There’s something about seeing a human and seeing them be kind of goofy and silly that lowers people’s natural guards when they’re hearing an argument. If you don’t trust me nothing I say is going to matter” he says.
.
Carlos says that he’s basically been training for this career since he was a teenager. “I was super heavy and nerdy. I was more feminine than the other boys. And I wasn’t athletic. I was always an outsider” he says of his high school days. “I joined debate the first week of freshman year and immediately became obsessed with it because I suddenly felt like I had a voice and could make good arguments. For a nerdy closeted fat kid that is very empowering. It was life-changing.”
.
So after three more years of high school debate plus four in college he made a career out of it — by moving to DC to advocate for and write about LGBT issues. But he eventually got bored with writing. “I felt like I had gifts that debate had given me that I wasn’t able to use using the written word so I just asked if I could start making videos. I had no idea what I was doing but I loved being able to present arguments in a visual way.” .
His own disappointment in coverage of the social issues he cares most about led him to focus on the media specifically: “If you don’t know a gay person or a trans person you’re going to hear about it through the news. So if the news is crappy that’s a really big problem” he says.

654,,,"In the hours of debate leading up to the Senate vote to repeal Obamacare on Wednesday Democrats did everything they could to shame Republicans calling the GOP efforts ""reckless"" ""bad"" ""cruel"" and ""immoral."" Sen. Bernie Sanders took his criticism in another direction: calling out Republicans for their secretive process and the lack of hearings on the three bills up for a vote.
.
At the microphone Sanders sarcastically asked his colleague Sen. Ron Wyden how many hearings Republican senators had held to analyze the economic impact of the three bills they are considering. (Watch the full exchange above). Congressional Democrats held hundreds of hearings as they crafted the Affordable Care Act. Congressional Republicans on the other hand have focused instead on getting enough party votes to repeal Obamacare without much input from anyone else. They have also tried to ram through legislation without giving the Congressional Budget Office much time to analyze the potential impacts. When the CBO did score a few versions of their bills many lawmakers — and the White House — discredited the office’s work. The result is that many senators appear poised to vote on bills without understanding what the impact of each bill would be if passed into law. #Healthcare",healthcare,|They and their loved ones need to be included in this bill and not exemnt...see how that would go.😒|How many hearings did they have before Obama care passed?|@ben_crasnean apparently countless|This man is fighting for what he believes is just not for what he thinks will line his pockets.

They’ll debate the House’s health care bill for the next day or so while they scramble to figure out what exactly they want to pass at the end of this process.

There three possibilities in play: 
1️⃣ Skinny repeal” the new proposal which would get rid of the individual mandate along with a few other unpopular provisions.

2️⃣A full repeal of Obamacare’s spending and health insurance coverage expansion with no replacement (the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act or ORRA for short)

3️⃣ A repeal-and-replace plan that senators have been working on for months (the Better Care Reconciliation Act or BCRA). Moderates are concerned about this plan’s steep Medicaid cuts and coverage losses: 22 million fewer Americans with health insurance 10 years from now. 
Meanwhile outdoors on the Hill several advocacy groups including the Center for Independent Living and the disability rights group ADAPT gathered to protest the vote.

Donald Trump’s son-in-law and top aide released a public statement about the Russia scandal on Monday morning — followed by a brief address to the press — previewing what he’s going to say in closed-door congressional testimony this week.

“I did not collude nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent” #Kushner writes. “Hopefully this puts these matters to rest.”

658,,,"Since taking over Bill O’Reilly’s slot on Fox News Tucker Carlson has had the most-watched news show on cable. His populist rhetoric and interview style have earned him millions of nightly viewers as well as the attention of one particular group: white supremacists. Richard Spencer for example argues that Carlson shows an “open-mindedness” to white supremacist ideas that O’Reilly didn’t. Former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke frequently tweets praise of Tucker’s show. And the white supremacist website Daily Stormer has called Carlson “literally our greatest ally.” In the latest episode of #Strikethrough Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) explains how white supremacists’ affection for Carlson has a lot to do with the way he talks about immigrants: he has spent the first few months of his show depicting both legal and undocumented immigrants as potentially dangerous criminals. He’s gone after Mexicans Muslims and refugees — and this immigrants-are-criminals shtick is just part of his broader rejection of multiculturalism which he sees as a threat to “European culture” and “Western civilization.” That kind of language suggests that Carlson’s rhetoric isn’t actually about immigration — it’s about teaching the largest audience in cable news to view difference as dangerous.

663,,,"With the Better Care Reconciliation Act dead for now President Trump is on to a new health care plan: rather than try to improve the American people’s health care situation make their health care situation as bad as possible and blame Democrats for the outcome.
.
There are two big problems with this conceptually writes Matt Yglesias on our site today. One is that it’s simply very unlikely an incumbent president can convince voters not to blame him for bad things that are happening. That’s simply not how politics works — 59 percent of people told a Kaiser Family Foundation poll they’d blame Republicans. The other is that huge swaths of Obamacare — notably Medicaid expansion but also the exchanges in blue states with high population density and a political establishment that wants to make them work (think Oregon or Massachusetts) — are definitely not failing.
.
That said especially in states with shakier exchanges the president certainly does have some fairly broad discretionary authority that he and his health and human services secretary can use to deliberately sabotage the program if they want to. Whether Trump ultimately follows through or not the fact that this is his instinct underscores that from health care to Russian hacking to corruption the signature theme of Trump’s approach to politics is putting Donald Trump’s interests ahead of anyone else’s.

Fox hosts this week attempted to minimize and normalize the failed attempt at collusion describing it as an example of routine opposition research. “How many lobbyists in Washington routinely meet with foreign agents who are seeking to influence American policy? ... That’s standard here and has been for a long time” argued Tucker Carlson. “Always happens and if anyone says it doesn’t it’s a lie” said Sean Hannity.

674,,,"Meet Julia Belluz Vox’s senior health correspondent.

On her mind lately has been Concordia Louisiana a county that she reported from last year that has some of the worst health outcomes in America. If the GOP health bill moves forward the people there would be at risk of growing sicker.

When Julia first visited the city to meet with health professionals and community members she was shocked by what she found: extremely high rates of obesity diabetes STDs child poverty maternal mortality — “by every measure people there are suffering” she says. “It was made very clear that Louisiana is a place that had been until its new governor came in January shredding the safety net for people. It’s really affected their lives and their health. They’re not getting access to the services they need. We went to houses that lacked basic sanitation … their waste water would just run out into their yards where their children were playing. To see in this super wealthy country people living like that was really disturbing”. Under the current draft of the Senate GOP health bill hundreds of thousands of Louisiana’s working poor including people in Concordia could lose the Medicaid coverage they depend on. (Read some of Julia’s reporting on the potential impact of the bill via the link in our bio). But Julia doesn’t stop at health policy. On her desk you’ll find books pictured in slide 4 by bold thinkers who go after misrepresentations of science — like British physician Ben Goldacre — inspiring her to debunk health trends and diets based on “pseudoscience.” She’s debunked everything from the misuses of antibiotics for colds to Gwenyth Paltrow’s notorious lifestyle brand Goop. This week she’ll publish a feature on maternal mortality on Vox.com. #FacesofVox",facesofvox,"|A little more about Julia: 
What keeps you going? “I’m learning about new things every day. I can be studying personalized nutrition one day an Ebola vaccine the next health segments on Alex Jones another day.

675,,,"Under the Senate Republican health care bill 22 fewer million Americans would have health insurance in 2026 compared with Obamacare according to new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. As soon as next year 15 million more Americans would be uninsured. 
CBO’s projections would represent an abrupt turn from the trends under Obamacare; the US uninsured rate had dropped below 11 percent in late 2016. The office has estimated that there are currently 26 million uninsured Americans; that would increase to 49 million by 2026 under the Senate Republican plan.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had been pushing for a vote by the end of the week and he could only lose two votes. But by Tuesday afternoon at least five Republican senators said they would not support a procedural vote to start debate on the bill as currently written — enough to stop it. Senate Republicans are expected to continue their debate on the health care bill after the July 4 holiday but conservative opposition to the plan is hardening.

676,,,"Around 7:30 pm on Monday Sen. Cory Booker and civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis walked alone from the House side of the US Capitol to the Capitol steps to discuss Senate Republicans’ health care bill.

Other senators Capitol Hill staffers and members of the public began to join them. About four hours later what began as an impromptu get-together of two men had swelled to a 300-person strong rally at the Capitol — and perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of opposition to the Senate Republican health bill yet.

The gathering came in the midst of efforts by resistance leaders to dramatize the extent of the public’s opposition to the bill. Left-wing activists believe that if they can draw enough public attention and scrutiny to the bill — which the Congressional Budget Office estimated would result in 22 million fewer Americans having health insurance — they can cow Republicans into not passing it. It only takes three Senate Republican defections for the bill to be defeated and so far at least five have said they oppose it in its current form.

President Trump shows a deep distrust of America’s democratic institutions: he criticizes sitting judges questions the legitimacy of an election he won and punishes news outlets he believes cover him too harshly. This process equates to what’s called “backsliding” — the slow erosion of a country’s democratic institutions by its elected leaders.

680,,,"Senate Republicans have finally revealed the Better Care Reconciliation Act their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act that has long been crafted in secret.

In short the bill asks low- and middle-income Americans to spend significantly more for less coverage. It would roll back the ACA’s expansion of the Medicaid program which currently covers millions of low-income Americans and include additional cuts to Medicaid. It would rework the individual market so that enrollees get less financial help to purchase less generous health insurance with higher deductibles.

681,,,"At 6 years old Timmy Morrison has a deeply personal stake in the current health care debate.

Timmy was born seven weeks premature and spent the first six months of his life in the hospital. He still has significant health issues due to a rare genetic disease. He has been under anesthesia more than 45 times.

Before Obamacare many health insurance plans (including Timmy’s) had lifetime coverage limits. They would cap how much one person could spend on medical care often at $1 million. Obamacare banned those limits six days before Timmy was born. He went on to spend more than $2 million during his first hospital stay.

Republicans typically say they support leaving this ban in place. Still the House-passed American Health Care Act would allow big employers to reinstitute lifetime limits. 
So on Tuesday morning Timmy arrived at the US Capitol with a bright orange shirt and a wide grin to do what hundreds of others were there to do: lobby Congress.

She’d spent most of her life in Kakuma a refugee camp in Kenya for years waiting to find out where she’d be able to build her life. Finally in 2016 she received a letter informing her she’d been selected to resettle in the US. “Maybe after all my dream is really valid and it’s going to come true” she thought. “If I’m going to America then it’s the best thing.”
But following the election of Donald Trump things quickly changed. During his first weeks in office  he issued his notorious “travel ban” executive order. It affected her doubly: as a Somali the order barred her from entering the US for 90 days; and as a refugee it blocked her for 120 days. 
Trump’s ban has been challenged in court successfully and the order is not currently in effect. Since he became president thousands of refugees have been resettled in the US. However Abdi Halane’s case remains in limbo as she waits to renew her medical certification. All she can do is check her status online.

Forty-nine percent expect they’ll be left worse off under the AHCA according to the Kaiser Family Foundation compared with 41 percent of people who buy coverage at work and 42 percent who buy their own plans.

Medicaid enrollees have good reason to worry: The House-passed American Health Care Act would phase out the Medicaid expansion beginning in 2019. It would also change how the federal government reimburses states for Medicaid expenses and would introduce the option of states turning the money into a “block grant” a lump sum rather than a per-person payment for each Medicaid patient which would cut the program still further.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that these changes would cut $880 billion from the Medicaid program and cause it to cover 14 million fewer people by 2026.

While he has seen the effects of the opioid epidemic firsthand he says his biggest challenge in his work is getting others to realize the scope of a public health crisis that shows no signs of slowing. “The opioid epidemic [is] horrifying. … It’s one thing to say those numbers; it’s hard to explain to people why they should care.” His latest piece — one that involved what he calls his most memorable reporting experience — involved visiting a facility in Vancouver British Columbia that gives heroin to drug users suffering from addiction.

687,,,"For months now thousands have taken to the streets of #Venezuela each day to protest a power grab by the country’s increasingly unpopular president Nicolás Maduro. Dozens have died and thousands more have been injured in clashes — and the political and economic chaos ravaging one of the world’s biggest oil-producing nations shows no signs of slowing.

It would be easy to blame it all on Maduro who has been looking for ways to sideline the country’s opposition-controlled parliament. The real culprits Pedro Rosas wrote for Vox in May are the justices of Venezuela’s Supreme Court who stunned observers inside and outside the country this spring when they passed a ruling essentially dissolving parliament and taking all of its powers for themselves. That meant Maduro’s United Socialist Party — which effectively controls two of the three main branches of the government in Venezuela — had made the third branch largely irrelevant.

It’s not a standard Pride event which have always been about celebrating LGBTQ identities.

689,,,"The British election results are shocking and confusing. Here’s a brief breakdown of what’s happened:

Technically Prime Minister Theresa May won the election. Her Conservative Party (also called the “Tories”) got the most votes and the most seats in Parliament. While they didn’t win a majority of seats in Parliament — which is what gives you control of the government in the UK system — it looks like they’ll be able to form a government by forging an alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) a right-wing regional party in Northern Ireland.

Nonetheless this election is a catastrophe for both the Conservative Party and May. Prior to the vote they *did* have a parliamentary majority —  which meant they controlled enough seats to push through legislation on a party-line vote without having to rely on unreliable partners like the DUP on issues ranging from pension cuts to modernizing Britain’s nuclear arsenal to Brexit.

This wasn’t enough for May. She wanted to go even further: to win a larger majority so that she’d have a mandate to push for her preferred version of Brexit one where the UK would sharply limit future immigration and trade with the European Union. Oops.

692,,,"Former FBI Director James Comey revealed Thursday he immediately began documenting his meetings with Donald Trump because of his concerns with the president’s “nature.” In April the New York Times reported that Comey began writing down his interactions with the president after a January 6 meeting at Trump Tower. “I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo. To ensure accuracy I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting” said Comey’s prepared opening statement for the committee released Wednesday.

This isn’t surprising: Trump’s consistent elisions of the truth have been obvious to many for more than a year. But hearing the former FBI director directly castigate the sitting president’s character was remarkable nonetheless.

Borders can seem almost arbitrary when you look at a map but these lines have enormous impact on people’s lives. That story — the human story of what happens when we draw lines on a map — is the story we want to tell but we need your help. 🔸

Based on your suggestions Vox’s @JohnnyWHarris will travel to six borders around the world this summer. And he wants you be a part of the reporting: follow along on Johnny's Facebook and Instagram to see where he's going make suggestions and ask follow-up questions. 🔸

696,,,"FBI Director James Comey said Wednesday that he had no choice but to tell Congress that the FBI reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server just two weeks before the 2016 election — and suggested he had no regrets about doing so even though he acknowledged it may have impacted the outcome.

Testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee Comey argued that not sending the letter would have “destroyed” the FBI’s reputation because it would look like the bureau was trying to cover up potentially important new information to protect a political candidate.  It’s his most thorough defense yet for throwing the election season into chaos.

Clinton and many of her supporters believe Comey’s decision swung the election. Speaking at a high-profile event in New York Tuesday Clinton blamed her loss on Comey and a concerted Russian effort to harm her candidacy and help Trump. Democrats though are not the only ones who hold this view.

The problem is: O’Reilly’s replacements aren’t much of an improvement. Fox’s new primetime lineup is stacked with network personalities with their own histories of harassing women including guests and even co-hosts.

701,,,"Sunday’s election in France resulted in a victory for the far-right Marine Le Pen (who came second to upstart centrist Emmanuel Macron) but at the same time demonstrated the very clear limits of her popularity. The numbers indicating that the tolerant center is likely to hold suggest that the far-right has a political ceiling: while its supporters may be hard-core the majority of Europeans still recoil from its vision — at least for now.

This mirrors what’s happening in much of Europe: After the twin shocks of Brexit and Trump the far-right has seen a series of setbacks. From elections in Austria and the Netherlands to polls in all-important Germany the far-right is performing far less well than many have expected.

How stable this situation is however — whether the far-right’s influence can be contained forever — is still a very open question. While the movement may have had a bad few months the deeper forces fueling its rise remain very much at work. And even if it never wins another election its success has already led to some mainstream parties adopting hardline positions on immigration and the EU.

703,,,"In an interview earlier this month President Trump told the Washington Post “The best thing politically is to let Obamacare explode.” The theory here is that an Obamacare explosion would reveal massive problems in the law Democrats passed and voters would blame the minority party for the failure. 
The data however does not agree with Trump. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll finds that most voters (61 percent) say it would be Trump and the Republicans' fault if #Obamacare stopped working. 
The survey asked respondents to select who they felt was most responsible for any problems with the Affordable Care Act going forward — the party that passed the law or the party that is now in control of the government. The third piece of the pie reflects those who selected “neither” “equal responsibility” or “someone else.” It's kind of like the Pottery Barn rule as Vox’s Sarah Kliff puts it: you break it you buy it. “Of course voters will blame the people in charge when something goes wrong with their health insurance.” For more on the latest #healthcare news sign up for our VoxCare newsletter at vox.com/voxcare.",obamacare healthcare,|Damn right.

If a wall were to slice through these ecosystems it could cause irreversible damage to plants and animals already under serious threat.

Activists who’ve been tracking fence construction over the years say they think part of the 28 miles of new levee wall the Trump administration has requested funding for will bisect the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge a collection of dozens of tracts of habitat stretching from Brownsville by the Gulf of Mexico to Rio Grande City about 100 miles west.

The decision to attack was a direct reaction to the Syrian regime’s Tuesday gas attack that claimed 85 lives including about two dozen children. Images of the Syrians who suffocated to death seemed to shock President Trump who spoke Wednesday of the “beautiful little babies” killed in the attack which he described as “an affront to humanity.” Trump went even further Thursday telling reporters that “something should happen” to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because of his responsibility for the attack. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson meanwhile said Assad would have “no role” governing Syria in the future and that “steps are underway” for a US-led international push to remove him.

Each day #Trump is looking more bound by the political system he promised to upend. The outcomes we’re seeing look like what you’d expect from an inexperienced unfocused president who’s more interested in tweeting out cable news commentary than learning about the government he runs and the policies he wants to change. Merely 10 weeks into his term the processes skills and institutions Trump flouted as a candidate are breaking him as a president.

This translates into historically low popularity. Trump is less popular than Barack Obama was at any point during his two terms. It took President George W. Bush a disastrous war to hit Trump’s current polling nadir.

The World Economic Forum ranks 145 countries on women's equality on a scale of 0 (no equality) to 1 (full equality). The highest score of all is Iceland clocking in at 0.881 — not bad but not fully equal. The US is 28th with a score of 0.740. Last is Yemen at 0.484.

The score is based on many factors: how many women participate in the workforce how well women are paid compared with men health and educational outcomes and political empowerment and representation in government. Some countries fare better than others but none is deemed fully equal under these metrics.

But to accomplish any further change there needs to be awareness of the issues that women uniquely face in the world today.

740,,,"Republicans began to lay serious groundwork for Obamacare repeal last winter. In January both the Senate and the House passed a reconciliation bill that took apart Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid and private subsidized health insurance.

The bill didn’t matter much at the time — Obama repealed it when it arrived at his desk — but it showed that Republicans could use the reconciliation process to take apart key Obamacare pillars requiring a simple majority rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.
This is the type of bill that Republicans are likely to use when they pursue Obamacare repeal in early 2017. 
Congressional leaders have promised that a few years down the line they would follow up with a replacement plan that would provide coverage for many. If that didn’t happen the Urban Institute estimates that repeal on its own would increase the number of Americans without insurance coverage by about 30 million in 2017. This would largely reflect a loss of coverage in both the individual market as well as Medicaid. #Obamacare",obamacare,|The fact the Republicans are pushing ahead with this is really unbelievable and really fundamentally immoral.

742,,,"To understand why Secretary of State John Kerry — and many others on both sides of the conflict — see Israeli settlements as such a dire threat to the viability of a future Palestinian state you need to grasp two important things: the first is that the entire area of land we’re talking about here which encompasses both Israel and the Palestinian territories is incredibly tiny. This is why even the smallest settlements can cause major backlash especially when they’re located in places that if they were to remain would break up a future Palestinian state into disconnected chunks of land and prevent it from being contiguous.

The second is the explosive growth of both the settler population and the number of settlements over the past several decades. The Israeli settler population in the West Bank alone — not including East Jerusalem — has increased by nearly 270000 since the 1990s-era Oslo peace accords and by 100000 since President Obama took office in 2009. And the Israeli government recently approved the construction of another new settlement well east of the separation barrier.

That’s because every time Donald Trump chooses to use his Twitter platform to directly target someone he’s angry with he’s not just putting them directly in front of his 17 million Twitter followers. He’s putting them directly in front of some of Twitter’s most fervently bigoted users — ones whose culture of online harassment has created an environment in which they are more likely to dehumanize their targets and detach from the harm they cause.

Importantly however these drugs don't cure patients; they only suppress the HIV virus to the point that it's undetectable in the blood.

2) Winning the toss-up states of Florida and North Carolina

1) Holding her six “firewall” states: Virginia Colorado Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Those states combined with the solidly Democratic states would give her the presidency.

2) If she loses one or more firewall states she’d likely have to make up for those losses with similarly-sized wins in one or more of the following: Nevada North Carolina and Florida — the diverse toss-up state trio.

But there is proof of just the opposite. When Buzzfeed’s Andrew Kaczynski and Nathan McDermott sifted through old recordings of Trump on The Howard Stern Show they came up with one hell of a scoop from the September 11 2002 episode—during which Trump responded to the question “Are you for invading Iraq?” with “Yeah I guess so.” For a normal candidate this would be a devastating blow to his credibility.

But Donald Trump isn’t a generic Republican — and he is polling at 45.1 percent of the two-party vote according to the Huffington Post Pollster. The difference between those numbers — 5.8 points as of August 19th — is what we’re calling the Trump Tax: the electoral penalty Republicans appear to be paying for nominating Trump.

And remember during the civil war when she was against civil rights and she was a Goldwater girl? At the same time in history Bernie marched with Martin Luther King. Yes she SAYS shes going to do all this stuff but would she really? Her best intrest is only herself as shes proved to the public over her years.

You have to understand that political views can change over time and that the Hillary Clinton who was a Goldwater girl in her youth is not the Hillary Clinton of today. To address some of your other points Hillary has advocated for raising the federal minimum wage but up to a much more reasonable $12 because she understands that Arkansas is not the same as California and that $12 is what most Democratic economists recommend. Hillary's platform isn't that different from Bernie's at all. Hillary wants universal healthcare-only she's more flexible about how we attain it. She too wants to overturn Citizens United and has a long and consistent record of fighting for campaign finance reform. When she was a Senator keep in mind that she voted the same way as Bernie 94% of the time. Trump has also switched many of his views. He has been both pro-life and pro-choice for and against assault weapon bans and in favor of both bringing Syrian refugees in and kicking them out. However while Hillary has switched some of her views they haven't been nearly as drastic as Trump. For Trump you don't know what he believes.|@makaylakraynak I'd like to suggest an article Zachary Leven's ""The Case For Hillary"" that explores HRC from a very objective non-cynical lens.

But you don't think for one second Clinton hasn't been spending her years in the State department or in Washington guaranteeing her nomination for the past eight years after stepping down to Obama?

This is bigger than our moral high ground and we would be selfish hypocrites to abandon ship because we are upset about a system we have known was rigged all along. We have proof! For once! But we cannot let the be the end. Bernie says to vote for Hilary because he knows what we all know and that's that Trump has to lose|@beans_andcornbread are you joking?

Because you know Howard Zinn or Noam Chomsky? You can read all you want but you know that if we participate in the system we influence it. You are right it's bullshit. The whole process and the government is brought to you by whoever bought them. So maybe that's true...or maybe that's oversimplified too. But why don't you offer up some suggestions or you can just sit back and critique the comments like you planned on doing|@beans_andcornbread know that you know nothing.|@beans_andcornbread when people say go read a book and someone like me who has read and listened to those men it makes me question if they were wrong. If maybe they were defending people who rightly don't belong because they do not contribute to society until its some retrospective criticism they felt they had the moral high ground to say. They ultimately failed to offer any suggestions towards utopia but only warned of the dangers of progressing towards  authoritarian systems and what those might resemble. Which are interesting observations and important in avoiding making the same mistakes. Yet they were apart of society yes they thought for themselves buy only in a society that was largely happy with not thinking for themselves.
