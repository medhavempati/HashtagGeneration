1,,,A week ago a woman in the Juhapura area in Ahmedabad had filed a police complaint claiming that her husband had cut off her tongue while pretending to kiss her. She had to be rushed to the hospital where her tongue had to be surgically reattached while her husband remained on the run. But now the police have finally caught the man named Ayyub Mansuri who claimed to have cut off his wife's tongue because it fused with his during a passionate make-out session. Turns out he has history of murder and violence with his first two wives as well.

Say “hemp” though and you’re lucky if you get any reaction at all. Funnily enough they’re both terms largely referring to the same plant cannabis one that has been used by humanity for well over 5000 years. From this plant comes pot's sibling hemp which contains far less or no psychoactive properties and instead can be used to make cloth paper biodegradable plastic even hemp concrete.

5,,,After over 70 days communications blockade imposed on Kashmir after the Indian government revoked Article 370 of the Indian Constitution that gave the state political autonomy the authorities have allowed some semblance of normalcy. As of October 14 some 4 million postpaid connections of the BSNL network in the state have been restored. However the connections remain suspended for 2.6 million more mobile users along with access to the internet. Communication blackout has been heavily criticised and warned about as a trigger for unrest and human rights violations. However the government has made reassurances that the move is for the safety of the people. Find out more about what this move means for Kashmir on the link in bio.

Just as the grieving father was putting down his daughter and preparing to say goodbye he heard the faint sound of an infant crying.

Artist Subodh Gupta slapped a case against @Herdsceneand  seeking Rs 50 million ($702K) in damages from the account admins for posting allegations of sexual misconduct by multiple anonymous survivors. Now the Delhi High Court has directed Instagram to reveal the identity of the users linked to the anonymous account along with orders to remove posts containing disclosures. Last year on the same day when the #MeToo movement shook India it also broke a pattern of silence broke among (mostly) women who were sexually harassed and assaulted by (mostly) men in powerful positions.

21,,,"Assam has recently made international headlines for something that sounds mundane enough: a census. 
But India's National Register of Citizens (NRC) is more than that. Designed to weed out illegal immigrants in Assam the NRC has already been accused by human rights groups as being a tool for discrimination. Around 1.9 million citizens were omitted from the final list their future as Indian citizens now uncertain.
If stripped of their citizenship these people may be forced to live without the right to work vote or receive aid in a country that refuses to recognize them. The international media has folded the NRC into the Hindu nationalism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his right-wing party the BJP; scores of human rights groups have called the NRC an extension of the party's anti-Muslim agenda which includes the revocation of autonomy in majority-Muslim Kashmir.
But the community of Bengali Muslims in Assam is caught in the middle of a threat that extends even beyond the national census. Increasingly volatile weather and environmental degradation threaten to wash away their homes their communities and the very land used to prove they're Indian citizens.

26,,,On September 23 16-year-old climate change activist Greta Thunberg—the catalyst of the school strike revolution that has inspired thousands across the globe to ditch school and work on Fridays to fight for a climate emergency—delivered a fiercely powerful speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit. Popularised by the words “How dare you” the speech is a no-bullshit message asking everyone to get off their asses stop being so money-minded and work towards a cleaner greener future. Being compared to other monumental speeches such as “I have a dream” by Martin Luther King the speech has touched a nerve with almost anyone who cares about the world.

27,,,Keeping the country on the brink of a blanket ban on single-use plastic (SUP) for over a month the Indian government has suddenly announced a change of plans. On October 2 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India would phase out SUP by 2022 instead. PM Modi has previously mentioned SUP ban during his August 15 speech as well as during the United Nations Climate Action Summit this year. But on Wednesday he stated that the blanket ban would not take place because government officials say that it is “too disruptive” for the industry currently in the light of economic slowdown and rising unemployment.

But recently the Save Indian Family (SIF) a consolidated group of more than 40 NGOs that claim to promote family harmony and gender equality hosted a puja to eradicate “evil feminists” in India.

Indian law system made many laws that protect women physically mentally and emotionally. Recently a new law made by Indian law system against showing middle finger on a women can be land in to jail but they don't think what happen when a women show that middle finger on a men? This is not fair soul never identify what the gender have  it hurts. And after came to this law many women promote #faminism .this is the wrong meaning of faminism. So first  make sure what is faminism and I don't think you need any kind of faminism to achieve ur goals and what u life want.

37,,,As we mark the final day of the global climate strikes VICE looks at the activism of Tibetans living in India who're bringing attention to the state of climate emergency in their homeland. Over the last few years research has shown that Tibet which is a source of water and other resources for 10 countries in the region including India is melting three times faster than the rest of the world. Then there are reports of human rights violations land grabbing mining and unprecedented construction by the Chinese government. But activism around Tibet also comes with a lot of danger for not just those outside of Tibet but also their families back home. We look at why the community that lives with the prospect of losing their homes forever not just to political oppression but also to the severe effects of climate change wants to bring attention to their homeland.

39,,,Being in the big house isn’t exactly supposed to be a sweet-sixteen slumber party. It’s a time of repentance reflection and retrospection and for a prisoner to truly turn his life around it’s important for prisons to make them live in conditions that urge them to regret their mistakes and start afresh. Except inmates in Rajasthan’s Ajmer jail were caught renting VIP luxury suites for Rs 8 lakhs and even paying extra to have access to banned substances like cigarettes. An investigation by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) into the bribery racket has revealed that every barrack in this prison had a “VIP room” that could be illegally rented by rich prisoners.

The petition is filed as the media streamers are violating many laws as to IPC IT ACT Indecent Representation of Women Act as well as Indian Constitution. Apart from that they are violating guidelines issued by the Central government. We are not against art. We are not against adults seeing any content they like to. There is no regulatory authority in India to provide certificates to these streamers. Talking about GOT... It is also certified and at the beginning certificates issued by their government are displayed. Also the content streamed by these media streamers is widespread and can be accessed by children aging between 10 to 14 yrs who is developing an intellect. What type of intellect will they develop?

41,,,When we walk into the Deonar garbage dump India’s oldest and one of Asia's largest the harsh reality hits us hard. At 327-acres wide and in some places 20 storeys high the dump receives more than 9000 metric tons of trash every day from Mumbai’s 20 million residents which accumulates to make it a dizzying and sickening spectacle. This is where residents in the slums surrounding the dump barely make it past the age of 40. This is also an area that serves as a source of income for some of the city's least fortunate: the ragpickers. But after the fires that engulfed the landfill many of the ragpickers have had to either switch to lower-paying jobs join the local garbage mafias or continue working by paying hefty bribes to the dump's security and thereby losing their earnings majorly. To top that social ostracisation and a drug problem continue to ravage their lives. Take an inside look into their lives by clicking on the link in the bio. #Deonar #Garbage #Mafia #DrugLords #Mumbai,deonar garbage mafia druglords mumbai,|Such an Underated Job in this country.

42,,,From being an essential accompaniment to your butter chicken binge to adding the right crunch and flavour to your bhel onions are an important ingredient in every Indian kitchen. But lately onion prices are soaring with the vegetable which is usually worth Rs 20 to Rs 40 a kilo shooting up to Rs 80 and projected to go up to Rs 100. And as onion prices continue to skyrocket across India reports of growers’ godowns being raided keep coming up as well. Onions worth Rs 8 lakh were stolen from a godown in Patna while another theft worth Rs 1 lakh was reported in Nashik.

But it looks like the authorities are taking things up a notch.

45,,,Women in gaming have long been considered an anomaly with popular belief relegating gaming to geeky teenage boys spending several hours on PUBG while women who actively take an interest in gaming are dismissed as only doing so to impress their crush.

46,,,In the light of the alarming reports on the dangers of living in Mahul Mumbai and the sustained agitation put up by the residents who’ve been forced to live there the Bombay High Court has given a big victory to the people. On Monday September 23 the court directed the BMC to move out the 5000-odd families living in this heavily industrialised neighbourhood within 12 weeks or pay a rent of Rs 15000 per month to each family for alternative homes outside Mahul. Over the last two years Mahul has been in the news for all the wrong reasons—levels of pollution so high that residents are falling sick and contracting infections and diseases some of which turn out to be fatal.

47,,,Giving a woman the middle finger can land you in jail. In New Delhi a man learned this the hard way when he was booked for showing the finger to his sister-in-law under Section 509 (word gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and Section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code. Now he might be looking at jail time of up to three years and a fine. But this is not the first time when giving the finger has landed Indian men in trouble.

48,,,We know it’s important to wrap it before you tap it but in this bizarre case Delhi cab drivers have been keeping condoms in their first-aid kits because they think they’ll be issued a fine for not doing so. It all started when an Uber driver named Dharmendra claimed to have been fined for not carrying a condom even though traffic officials insist it isn't a punishable offence. Meanwhile the Delhi Sarvodaya Driver's Association a drivers' union has asked all cab drivers to compulsorily keep at least three condoms in their cars but even more weirdly enough not because of anything to do with safe sex.

51,,,The Himalayas are home to the tallest mountains in the world and are covered in a layer of ice that’s beaten only by the North and South Poles earning them the title of the “Third Pole”. But satellite data from 1975-2000 shows that climate change is “eating” at the Himalayan glaciers causing them to melt at double the speed since 2000. In recent years the glaciers have lost about eight billion tons of water a year—or the equivalent of 3.2 million Olympic-size swimming pools. Whether you live in the Himalayas or not or are a frequent traveller or not this should be alarming for us all.

52,,,On September 22 as India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicks off the event “Howdy Modi” in Houston Texas which is subbed to discuss the “Shared Dreams Bright Futures” of India and the United States of America Kashmir will enter its 48th day of blockade by the Indian government who also at the same time aims to strip more than 1.9 million people in Assam of their citizenship. In protest a group of South Asian performers are organising “Fuck Modi: Noise for Kashmir” a benefit to be held in Brooklyn New York that brings together artists protestors and activists aiming to give the PM what they call “a true New York welcome filled with opposition demonstrations”. VICE caught up with two of the performing acts—Desi-American punk band @therealkominas and comedian @arish_ish—to know more about this protest show.

Tibet holds the largest store of fresh water outside the North and South Poles. Right now Tibet is warming three times faster than the rest of the earth resulting in eight billion tonnes of ice being lost every year as glaciers disappear. 
As the source of many of the world’s largest river systems including the Ganges the Yangtze and the Mekong Tibet provides water for over 1.5 billion people - one fifth of the global population. 
Tibet is the Climate Crisis people have never heard of - a crisis that China tries to hide. Evidence shows that what is happening in Tibet is overwhelmingly because of the actions of humans. Tibetans who live in Tibet under China’s brutal occupation cannot be part of the conversation but it is vital that they are part of the solution.  #GlobalClimateStrike #TibetClimateCrisis #ClimateEmergency

55,,,"The Delhi edition of the global climate strikes saw some 2000+ people-a number that's surprising in an otherwise apathetic country-coming on the streets and raising their concerns on climate change. Organised by Extinction Rebellion and Fridays for Future the massive protest saw students teachers parents professors and literally people from all walks of life. The most common chant was that of ""azaadi"" (Freedom) from pollution emissions and everything that hurts the earth. Coming from one of the most polluted cities in the world the message was delivered with a lot of anger enthusiasm and a general sentiment of 'now or never' and especially aimed at the political leaders. The procession peaceful and powerful ended early evening with one hope: that it's bigger and better the next time.

57,,,Since August 5 there have been 8 million people less on the internet—in a snap. Thanks to the communication clampdown that was put in force while revoking Jammu & Kashmir’s special status and which continues even after 40 days the population of the once-state remains cut off from the rest of the world. Kashmir’s Gen Z like the demographic in the rest of India has been raised on the internet. From using it as a source of news a means to get a date a platform to play games or watch porn in incognito mode Kashmir’s Gen Z is no different from others. Just that they are the ones who lose mobile and internet connectivity most frequently in the world. But this time around the blackout has been unprecedented. With this as the background VICE asked young Kashmiris how they are coping with their phones and computers going redundant.

59,,,As various reports show India approaching ‘Day Zero’ (the day when a place’s taps dry out and people have to stand in line to collect a daily quota of water) a top Indian expert has warned that Indians may soon become “water refugees” who’ll migrate to water-rich European countries. Rajendra Singh a Magsaysay-winning conservationist and environmentalist and popularly known as the “Waterman of India” recently gave this grave picture of things to come in one of the most water-stressed countries in the world. The situation could very well be like those in Africa and Asia where people have actually migrated to European states and precipitated political crisis. Singh adds that this kind of migration can disturb the harmony of the world.

60,,,When we walk into the Deonar garbage dump India’s oldest and one of Asia's largest the harsh reality hits us hard. At 327-acres wide and in some places 20 storeys high the dump receives more than 9000 metric tons of trash every day from Mumbai’s 20 million residents which accumulates to make it a dizzying and sickening spectacle. This is where residents in the slums surrounding the dump barely make it past the age of 40. This is also an area that serves as a source of income for some of the city's least fortunate: the ragpickers. But after the fires that engulfed the landfill many of the ragpickers have had to either switch to lower-paying jobs join the local garbage mafias or continue working by paying hefty bribes to the dump's security and thereby losing their earnings majorly. To top that social ostracisation and a drug problem continue to ravage their lives. Take an inside look into their lives by clicking on the link in the bio.

61,,,Just a week after the US proposed a ban on flavoured e-cigarettes the Indian government has gone ahead and actually done it. India just officially approved a ban on the sale of all e-cigarettes and vaping devices with immediate effect. A decision the government has been mulling over since the Health Ministry said vaping could cause an “epidemic” the ban has been called as necessary by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman who also said such devices “pose a health risk to people especially young smokers” and have become more of a “style statement”. But vaping advocates and e-cigarette sellers are sceptical about the government's real intentions since this would only effectively ban the sale of both nicotine and non-nicotine products but not prevent people from owning or using them. We spoke to the Association of Vapers India and @altvapors an e-cigarette seller to understand what this ban really means for India.

And moreover why is the ministry of finance so much interested in banning e-cigarettes which is a matter to be dealt with the ministry of health? And most importantly people still do substance abuse in many things and not just e-cigarettes so why not bring in strict rules and regulations on the usage rather than a ban? BTW share prices of ITC and Godfrey Phillips already rocketed high today... So something somewhere doesn't seem right and logical in this whole act...

In a ruling issued on August 1 the college mandated that all students at this all-girl college would be required to wear knee-length kurtis from thereon claiming it was a way to ensure uniformity. However students felt that this mandate was regressively patriarchal and an attempt by the college to moral police them by dictating what they can and can’t wear and some say college officials even said it was necessary because ""thighs attract boys"".

72,,,Transgender people often face sexual violence in more frequency than can be evidenced. So when the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha (it’s yet to be passed by the Upper House to become the law of the land) on August 5 the anger over the proposed law only intensified. Out of the many flaws of the bill was this glaring one: violence abuse and rape against transgender people can be punishable with jail time from six months to two years and a fine. Compare that with the punishment for rape of cis-gendered women which can give the offender from seven years of jail time to even life sentence—and you can see how unfair the proposed law reads. In response to this transgender people in India have begun a campaign with the hashtag #RapeIsRape to highlight that sexual violence knows no gender or sexuality.

76,,,Every year the last day of Ganesh Chaturthi is marked with freak accidents and deaths as lakhs of people descend into the mostly choppy sea waters to immerse the idols. This year the death toll in Maharashtra has reached 17 with five people missing. The festivities took place despite the state witnessing days of flooding and rainfall that have caused a lot of devastation. Plus the idols used for the visarjan are often made with environmentally damaging materials like Plaster of Paris and chemical paint which leads to the death of aquatic life. Last year thousands of dead turtles and fish washed up on Mumbai’s beaches. Even though the move towards eco-friendly idols has gained momentum it remains to be seen what repercussions this year’s visarjan will come with.

Researchers at the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP 14) have said that if desertification—where fertile land degrades significantly as a result of deforestation and agricultural practices—and improper use of land continue critically endangered species could become extinct. Read more about how this is affecting animal species populations at the link in the bio. #Wildlife #Extinction #EndangeredSpecies,wildlife extinction endangeredspecies,|Bummer|A previous version of this article said that the Great Indian Bustard was extinct rather than critically endangered and that the main cause of extinction of the other species was desertification.

81,,,India’s automobile industry one of the country’s biggest employers has crashed into one of the worst slumps.

In the 2018 index of the global consumption of weed Delhi appeared in third place while Mumbai came in at sixth. The study also placed Amsterdam—where weed and “soft drugs” are legal for personal use–at 56th place consuming 3.6 tons. This is just about a tenth of what Delhiites consumed.

99,,,"Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was read down around a year back but here's a story from small-town India that makes us wonder how long it'll take for acceptance. In the Alirajpur district of Madhya Pradesh a 19-year-old girl has been arrested by the cops for kidnapping a 17-year-old girl. The accused teenager who was known to the ""victim"" for almost two years was charged by the latter's father and the cops were quick to arrest her under Section 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code. However the minor girl has told the media that they're in love considers the 19-year-old as her ""husband"" and even lived in for five months last year. In one of the most homophobic countries in the world many such stories abound but do they become examples of real change? Find out more on link in bio. #Section377 #LGBTQ #Homophobia #Lesbian",section377 lgbtq homophobia lesbian,|ok what ?|Homophobia=💩|i support LGBTQ sentiments but not kidnapping lol|💯 yes|omg these kids|Her parents did wrong for arresting her lover . But those girls were wrong  risking their life and career at such an age not a good option . They could have stand on their feet to make themselves independent and also could gain trust upon themselves by their parents .|I mean if this was a hetrosexual case the guy would be in jail and this would be well supported by this page . Don't make it a case of homophobia if it ain't. Just cause you're gay or lesbian it doesn't give you the rights to run away and stay with a minor.|Just another example of atulya bharat #incredibleindia|As a law student charges of kidnapping could be levied even if the 19 year old was a boy as a 17 year old girl is considered a minor and her consent is immaterial. She may however prove to the satisfaction of the court that she's mature enough to take her own decisions and went with the person of her own free will after thoroughly understanding the consequences|Was it really kidnapping though? If the 17 y/o was with her gf by her own will then why press kidnapping charges?|Guys get your facts straight India is actually one of the least homophobic countries in the world. In fact homosexuality was openly accepted in the Indian society for centuries until the British came to India and imposed their law. Secondly the arrest was not made because the girls were lesbians but rather because the younger girl was 17 years old and thus technically a minor. The same would have happened had there been a boy as that's what the kidnapping laws in India dictate. Now we could debate upon whether or not a complaint by a father could lead to the arrest of a person his minor child had run away with but that's a completely different matter. In fact even if both the parties were heterosexual and the minor was a boy and the major was  a girl she would have still been arrested. No parent would ever agree to their 17 year old child running away with an adult irrespective of the gender. This has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the girls. The charges were kidnapping wherein the police are required by law to make the arrest of the accused on the bequest of the legal guardian. I mean how else would you get hold of the offender in case of a real kidnapping when the actual victim is missing.|By law the 17 year old is a minor so regardless of their sexual orientation  this has to be treated as a kidnapping case.

Now Abdul Basit the former Pakistani High Commissioner to India has gone and done it again by retweeting a piece of fake news that claimed a steamy scene featuring porn star Johnny Sins was actually a man called Yousuf from the Kashmiri city of Anantnag who was blinded by pellets. Basit also asked for everyone to raise their voice possibly meaning that people should speak up about the ongoing situation in Kashmir post the Article 370 abrogation.

Turns out a murder of crows keeps attacking the poor man for a misinterpreted mistake he says he made three years ago when he failed to save a crow chick. In this bizarre case Kewat claims that every time he steps out of his house he is mercilessly made the object of prey by the sharp-beaked birds who dive straight at him. While he is shook that these birds have such advanced facial recognition experts say it is highly likely as crows are intelligent animals capable of registering the faces of those they feel have wronged them.

103,,,"In a move that will almost certainly isolate the one million Rohingya refugees at Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar refugee camp the government has ordered telecommunications companies to shut down the camps’ mobile phone services. The order came on September 2 over what the Bangladeshi government is describing as “security grounds” claiming that refugees ""abuse"" mobile phone services to among other things smuggle methamphetamine pills or as they're colloquially known yaba. The police also claim to have dealt with cases of murder robbery gang war and family feuds within the camps. But many believe that this communication blackout has got nothing to do with any of this.

105,,,As photographer Aman Chotani travelled around India he discovered a pocket of the country which is largely sidelined. In the midst of rapid urbanisation and Westernisation there still exists a significant number of tribes and tribal communities in the country. When Chotani realised that these tribes retain their centuries-long traditions and are often ignored by the Indian government and society he knew he had to find a way to preserve these tribes. “I want this to act as an archive for future generations researchers or anybody who might be interested in knowing these tribes” Chotani told VICE. “To our dismay we realised how their cultures are slowly vanishing and being forgotten.

The movie is already pulling in early Oscar buzz with Deadline calling it a ""bravura piece of filmmaking that speaks to the world we are actually living in today in ways that few movies do."" Hollywood Reporter praised Phoenix's acting and claimed that the ""must-see factor of Phoenix's riveting performance alone—it's both unsettling and weirdly affecting—will be significant.""

108,,,When French chemist Antoine Jérôme Balard first synthesised amyl nitrite in 1844 he wanted to help alleviate chest pains in patients. Soon people figured out that the side-effects of amyl nitrite outweigh its momentary benefits: constant migraines difficulty in breathing blood pressure dropping and elevated heart rates being some of them. But somewhere between the 19th and 20th centuries gay men figured out that inhaling amyl nitrite renders their muscles relaxed and in turn their rectums thereby facilitating the deed of anal penetration.

109,,,It’s not easy to be a pehelwan in the age of swanky gymnasiums costly protein shakes and changing techniques but movies and medals are heralding renewed interest in the sport. Facing an era of wrestling fought on mat courts at international events akharas in Delhi have been training young men to keep this dying tradition alive while keeping in pace with modern techniques. These wrestling practice centres train pehelwans in martial arts on clay courts in the country’s age old Guru–shishya tradition often providing them facilities like lodging and healthy diet associated with the sport. The young wrestlers don’t have it easy. They have to fulfil the required diet exercise on rusted equipment and learn techniques through over-burdened teachers and videos on YouTube. And though a few boys in the akhara want to make their career in wrestling others want to use pehelwani to get jobs in the police army as bouncers and security guards—some of the only ways for the skills to translate into an income.

111,,,Authorities in the northeastern state of Assam are preparing to publish the final citizenship list—known as the National Register of Citizens (NRC)—on Saturday August 31. This aims to identify “genuine” citizens and strip others of their citizenship via what critics see as a messy bureaucratic process. This is possibly the largest such citizenship screening drive in the world. With millions of people in the crosshairs it achieves a similar end to Myanmar’s attacks on the Rohingyas but with four times as many people. On Thursday August 29 security measures were tightened across the state including in the capital city of Guwahati with Section 144 of the IPC imposed prohibiting the gathering of five or more people at one place. The centre has also sent 20000 additional paramilitary forces to Assam. To know everything about what's going on and what happens to those whose names who do not appear on the register click on the link in bio. 📸Reuters/Anuwar Hazarika #immigration #citizenship #Assam #News #India,immigration citizenship assam news india,"|How obvious does it have to be for people to realize that this is fascism?|Great going india  just great|We are already over populated and we don't need any more immigrants coming..... Yes. ...it is a difficult drive but it was very much needed... 👏👏|They’ll just migrate to other states duhh
Let’s welcome the refugees|No problem with sending the immigrants back. The problem is that there are many problems with the NRC and millions of genuine Indian citizens could be made stateless.|@sundance_kid_006 @hito_if_he|Those ""illegal immigrants"" are refugees who need our help. The world produces food that is more than enough the present population.(check huffpost) The statement that resources are scarce is a myth. Refugees are not a threat to our country they are probably more helpful than most politicians and CEOs. What's happening in USA and any country that treats immigrants and minority citizens as illegal or dangerous are bad and yeah that is a form of fascism too. Literally nobody denied that except for obviously people with right wing and centrist ideologies|I'm from assam i know exactly what's the condition of over population in our state. This drive is somehow very difficult but this end of the 2 - 3 years of management that the State was going through to control the immigrants from the neighboring countries. If anyone is feeling pity for the illegal migrants they should straightly blame the countries from which the refugees belong. Everything can't be perfect at least not for India so it may include some genuine citizens who will send off but the time given to prove themselves genuine was merely enough i guess . So overall its a good step to free up some space and build it more strong. @viceindia thanks for sharing this. 💕|Also who tf are these people deciding whether or not somebody ""deserves"" to live here or not? It's a piece of land. You don't own it and never will. You just temporarily occupy it. People who seek refuge here contribute to the society they live in. If you have a problem with unemployment don't ask the oppressed why they are ""stealing"" your jobs but question capitalists and the government on why have they created such an environment where people can't find jobs and are laid off even though they have the skills to effectively do a job. Why haven't they given you the resources and the agency to choose a job that is fulfilling and rewarding. The truth is these immigrants do the jobs you wouldn't anyway.

But the movement to save us from the hole we’ve dug up for ourselves just got an unlikely ally: Pornhub. The world’s biggest porn video site just dropped a video called ‘The Dirtiest Porn Ever’ and it’s some of the nastiest shit we’ve ever seen. That isn’t just because it features popular amateur pornstar couple LeoLulu getting down and dirty by the ocean adding ignition to most people’s sex-on-the-beach fantasy but it’s mainly because the beach they’re doing it on is dirtier than the act itself. Shot on an unspecified beach strewn with plastic bottles bags and buckets the video sees people in Pornhub-branded hazmat suits coming in to pick up plastic as the pair picks up the pace of their heavy petting.

The use of herbal (or traditional) medicine is high in the general population and it is also high among HIV positive people.
Our investigators went on a research in Africa and collected herbal medicine samples from urban and rural sites in eight states across Nigeria for drug analysis, following a standard protocol. They approached street vendors requesting traditional remedies for non-specific symptoms against a background of HIV and only purchased herbals sold as powders or liquids. They recorded instructions for use, date and site.
The University of Liverpool analysed the samples for efavirenz, nevirapine, lopinavir, darunavir, ritonavir, atazanavir, tenofovir, FTC, and 3TC using validated LC-MS/MS methods.The investigators found, of 742 patients aged 2 to 91 years, the prevalence of herbal medicine use was 41.8% (310
The investigators observed wide use of herbal medicines across all ages and in both genders regardless of educational or employment status. In over half the patients using herbal medicines, this preceded starting ART and continued during ART use: 82.2% who used herbal medicines were also receiving ART.
As the investigation was going on we found out this village herbalist who people around said has cured several persons with his herbal concoctions and we approached him, we went through the products and found truth in it. We bought one of the products and decided to confirm it on one patient here in Douala. The patient took it as instructed thereafter we put him on observations. Some days later we started seeing the changes, his CD4 count was becoming normal. After a week and some days we ran a re run test on him and it came out negative. We then proceed to two other different lab with same  results.  We (global health researchers) decided to partner with him and also recommend him to every victims/patients.We advised these patients to DM him @dr_agbadon_temple. for more enquiries and how you can get this guaranteed products.

The Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi declared that a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court would be in charge of examining the case in early October dismissing the argument that this would fuel “cross-border repercussions”. He also sent out a notice to the government to respond to petitions challenging this revocation and all the restrictions consequently put upon the state of J&K within seven days.

119,,,When it comes to McDonald’s in India It looks like not everyone is lovin’ it. Just a few weeks after food delivery app Zomato faced flak for distinguishing some restaurants with a ‘halal’ meat tag McDonald’s has hopped on to the boycott bandwagon after it declared in a tweet that all its meat is halal certified. Now while most people out here are fighting against eating meat entirely or how to kill animals in a more humane way others specifically a section of right-wing Hindu extremists on Twitter are more worried that their go-to burger joint is killing animals according to the Islamic law and catering to the minority religion. Many raised an issue over why McDonald's was serving halal meat in a country where 80 percent of the 1.3 billion people population were Hindus. But activists say this is another tactic to attack Muslims.

The entire controversy started with McDonald's explaining in a tweet thread the measures it takes to ensure that only Halal certified meat is served in its restaurants. Some people reasoned that since McD serves Halal meat it should serve Jhatka as well (Sikhs and many Hindus prefer Jhatka over Halal). They claim that if some religious sensibilities can be upheld then all religious sensibilities should be upheld. Since Halal slaughter is done as per Islamic law (i.e. only a Muslim butcher can do the slaughter the animal must face the direction of Qibla a Koranic verse must be read before the slaughter and the sacrifice must 'only' be made in the name of Allah) it is understandable that some people are uncomfortable with being forced to eat only Halal meat. They asked McD to give them assurance that their sensibilities will also be respected but McD hasn't yet replied. Since Twitter thrives on extremes some people got agitated by the non-responsiveness of McD and tweeted that they will boycott the chain till their voices are heard - a miniscule number of people. Most people didn't even care to get involved yes including 'right-wing Hindus'. The problem with this report is that it conveniently hides the real issue to give a xenophobic twist to the whole controversy. It blows the issue out of proportions to fit the 'Hindu extremist' tropes that work so well while reporting about India. Any form of religious assertion that can be twisted to fit into 'poor Muslim minorities are being oppressed globally' narrative has become the go-to line of thought for foreign correspondents (and their Indian comrades) who are not interested in understanding the extreme complexity of the Indian society and its problems. They forget that Muslims are not a minority in many parts of this country and in fact compose 1/6th of India's population. They forget that after Indonesia the largest number of Muslims live in India. Nothing is as simple as ""another tactic to attack Muslims as per activists."" The least Vice could've done is present the complete picture. You did not and that's emblematic of the gutter news media is in these days.|Useless🤣😂|I think people nowadays are allergic to living a healthier way of life just for the sake of going with the trend 😆|🤣🤣🤣|Excellent.

123,,,If you’ve seen Udta Punjab you already have an inkling of North India having a menacing drug problem which has reportedly only got worse in this region. A new study published by the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) interviewed about 1140 drug addicts and 1566 households in 16 districts in the north Indian states of Punjab Haryana Himachal Pradesh Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) looking into the reasons responsible for this issue and taking into account hard drugs like heroin chitta and opium banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The study found that 65% of addicts living in the above states became users between the ages of 15-20 which means three out of four addicts get hooked to the high even before they turn 21. It also found that addicts spend up to Rs 2000 on daily drug usage and pinpoints the reasons behind the rampant addiction.

In India many people treat marriage itself like a society-inflicted ticking time bomb set on anyone in their 20s as if staying unmarried is explosive and needs a bomb squad aka matchmaking relatives to come in and defuse the situation.

While it’s a landmark verdict by the Supreme Court the Indian queer community continues to fight for other civil rights including the right to marriage and adoption. Moreover social acceptance lags far behind legal privileges with the stigma that has bred over centuries continuing to rampantly exist. In the middle of this struggle is 30-year-old photographer videographer and activist @monishatpd—who runs @thephotodiary3 and is one of the top wedding photographers in the country.

But on August 21 the SC has now clarified what it meant by that and that is not every failed promise to marry can lead to a rape charge. This means that under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code which defines rape the key part of this verdict is to understand ""consent"". If a woman continues to have sex despite knowing that marriage is uncertain she cannot accuse the man of rape. Should Indian laws dictate intimate relationships?

134,,,A new Oxford University study found that packaged food and drinks made in India contain high levels of saturated fats sugar and salts and are the most unhealthy in the world. The George Institute for Global Health at the University of Oxford came to this conclusion after analysing more than 400000 food and drink products from 12 countries around the world using Australia’s Health Star Rating system to rank them. This system breaks down the nutrient concentration and measures the energy salt sugar saturated fat as well as protein calcium and fibre to give out a star rating that ranges from ½ (least healthy) to 5 ( most healthy).

135,,,It’s been over two weeks since Articles 370 and 35A that granted special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir in India have been scrapped but the region continues to be on a clampdown. Even though the curfew is eased and schools are slowly reopening families continue to keep their kids at home and the communication blackout continues. Even amidst all this unrest a new issue rears its ugly head. Apparently some hotels in Delhi are denying Kashmiris rooms as soon as they find out that they hail from the Valley with some saying this discrimination is being carried out on the basis of a “government order”. It started when Malik Aabid a student from the Jamia Millia Islamia University in Delhi ranted on Twitter about his friend a doctor from Kashmir being denied a room at an OYO budget hotel he had already booked and confirmed in advance after the manager saw his Aadhar card details.

And in the process she has been able to understand one core truth: that Kashmir is bigger than its conflict and that its people are now caught between violence and border politics with no voice left of their own in the matter. Which is why the 27-year-old decided to bring out her chronicles of this suffering and pain in the form of an exhibition (although you can check out her works on her Instagram handle too) titled 'Exhibit A' at Mumbai's @methodindia.

But turns out the breathtaking bioluminescence a phenomenon caused by the Noctiluca scintillans or algae—a type of phytoplankton that converts chemical energy into light energy—could very well spell troubled waters and be an indicator of climate change.

But in a story that seems straight out of the sets of a gritty Bollywood crime drama a female cop named Payal and a gangster she met at the court she was posted at while he was behind bars have got their happily ever after. Apparently the criminal named Rahul Thasrana stole her heart when he was arrested for the murder of a local trader in 2014. The two first met during his hearings at the Surajpur court in Greater Noida and kept in touch as Thasrana continued his on-again-off-again relationship with the world of crime getting more than a dozen cases registered against him since. Their courtship continued for many years and when Thasrana was finally released on bail the two went from jailbirds to lovebirds real quick and seized the moment to run away and get married in a secret location.

With phone and internet usage cut off during the ongoing lockdown authorities are allowing locals to use a mobile phone to briefly speak to their loved ones outside the Muslim-majority state. But nobody knows what is happening in North and South Kashmir in particular. With this as a backdrop this Eid there was in fact no Eid in Kashmir. Even as people surpassed the armed security personnel coils of barbed wire and barricades to offer prayers inside mosques it was far from a festival of celebration. “Is this Eid or Ashura the day of mourning?” one Kashmiri asked.

145,,,Between victim-blaming and an increasing number of reported rape cases in the country it’s almost become a pre-requisite for us to arm ourselves with some kind of self-defence—either pepper spray or sharp objects.

148,,,The Bombay High Court on Tuesday August 6 passed an order banning the slaughter of sheep and goats in private residences and housing societies on the basis of a petition filed by animal welfare groups. In its order which comes ahead of Bakr-Id on August 12 they declared that animals could only be killed at government-approved slaughterhouses after a public interest litigation brought up the issue of illegal transportation and slaughter of animals. Read more about why they took this decision at the link in bio. #bakraeid #eid #BombayHighCourt #Law,bakraeid eid bombayhighcourt law,"|These Muslims shitty point of views|These people will never change|😂|🙂I am glad to see some sensible people in this comment section who knows how it's significant.|If it was animal welfare they were actually concerned about this isn't how they would form the rule. Congrats everyone we're making the country even more intolerant. Woohoo.|I wish it was passed in Bengal too. Then I wouldn't have to stay indoors for 3 days. I don't understand why someone would slaughter animals in the streets before the public eye. It effects us...not everyone likes slaughtering and bloodshed. Me being an animal lover it's unbearable for me to see an innocent animal crying and writhing in pain  bleeding to death. It's not even necessary to kill animals for Qurbani...why kill them then? Why make them cry for our festivals? It's heartbreaking!|Cows should be ban from roads because for one religion she might be a mother but for other it’s just an animal blocking the roads and causing accidents|So the dumb fucks are totally against the slaughter here. Is this against non vegetarians then where are you guys whole year. And the animal who gets sacrificed is used later. We don't throw them away. It is equally distributed among poor and neighbors. Its OK to blame the minority these days. Try making a stand against major food outlets who serve non veg food. Your own government won't support you that time. You guys are only targeting this because its a festival of Muslims.|💯|Comment section is filled with snowflakes 🤦🏻‍♂️|What about the lynchings in public areas. Is that something pleasant to watch.|Let's ban use of water in holi|Let's ban crackers for curbing pollution|So I strongly feel that this move is simply to disturb the peace of the Muslim community and possibly encourage a riot and simply not regarding the welfare of animals. Because let's be honest there are so many animal cruelty cases happening in India everyday but there is no strict action taken against the perpetrators. India is still  one of the largest beef exporters in the world. What does that say to you ? I actually feel worried and scared looking into the future for muslims in this country. Now let me tell you about what QURBAANI really means to me as an individual. Irfan khan the actor had once said that what qurbaani really means is sacrificing the most special thing in your life sacrifice is not buying a goat from the market and slitting it's throat in the name of god. Sacrifice to me is giving up something that you love so much something that you are close to and sacrificing that for the lord is what real Qurbaani is. It doesn't have to be a living thing it could be a habit or a materialistic thing literally anything! I feel bad for the poor goats and how they are bred for a day like this. True Islam is a religion of peace and will always be.|👏|Even bursting crackers won't help should ban that too..!|Mera India chutiya ban Raha h.😍|Sahi hai yar|I mean why not ban abortions and every other meat too?

U must use  slaughter house|@niharikaasharma first of all its not killing and and govt should take an initiatve abt the environment pollution act done in diwali  ganesh chaturti and hoki etc etc  Because sacrificing requires big heart which you guys dont have and also every single piece of it is used and given to the neeedy and poor if you are so concerened abt the animals . SO YOU SHOULD ALSO READ THE animal Biology as it clearly says sheep goat and cows dont live a long live and they can reproduce 10-12 mammals in one life so the no of populatiion will be more than humans someday its better you concentrate on studies and a bright future rather than worrying abt our festivals|Waiting for the day when government bans the practice of Jallikattu.|Notice how this rule was passed just before EID that's because nationalist Hindu parties like BJP are trying to Target Muslims and try to ruin their ritual of slaughtering an animal in the sacred day of Eid.

Oh well oh well  fuckin war will never end over religion bullshit.|Good move! This is what they follow in the Gulf too.|This move was not solely for the animals but to target Muslims and disrupt their cultural practice. If there is a push for animal welfare the slaughtering of animals aka sentient beings such as chickens pigs fish should all be banned. Why is it only for killing animals in one’s own private home and estate? Why specifically sheep and goat? If you can’t kill an animal in your own home you shouldn’t be killing animals anywhere. I’m not Muslim but I am for animal rights. All animals are capable of perception and sentience they want to live. If you hurt an animal it will run in fear protect its children and fight for its life just like humans. None of them should be harmed or exploited in the name of consumership. I commented because I wanted to point out this move is not solely for the welfare of animals the gov is clearly targeting a specific group of people and disrupting their cultural practice through the law they’ve just gift wrapped it in a pretty tag that says “animal welfare” for us to ejaculate in our pants and say halleljuah wow our government is so amazing.|Yo my neighbors slaughter a goat every year n let me tell u seeing that poor thing fr a week n then seeing the bloodshed after just breaks my heart|Perfect|Fascism on the rise!|How can one file a complaint if this is not being upheld in certain areas?|Thats Mumbai you stupid not bombay|Yeh drama eid ke Baad shuru hojata hai.

That’s right. Film associations in the country are allegedly being flooded with applications from producers to register potential movie titles like Article 370 Kashmir Hamara Hai Article 370 Abolished and Kashmir Mein Tiranga.

151,,,Even as the country continues to debate the repercussions of the Modi government scrapping Kashmir’s special status it looks like some desperate men have marriage on their minds especially those living in West Bengal. At least that’s what a quick peek at Google search trends suggests with West Bengal emerging as the sub-region with the highest search results for ‘Marry Kashmir girl’ while others in Tripura really want to know more about girls from the Valley. People in Karnataka and Maharashtra are also curious according to the data from Google Trends. This appears to be happening after a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader from Muzaffarnagar sparked a row on Tuesday when he proclaimed that the party workers were “excited” because they will now be able to get married to “fair girls from Kashmir” followed with many misogynistic members of the Twitterverse letting their fantasies run loose.

152,,,In India the use of cannabis dates back to the Vedic times. Before India signed the Single Geneva Convention of 1961—which classified cannabis products and opiates as narcotics—ganja charas and bhang were sold through government outlets as per a system laid down by the British government. But the Rajiv Gandhi government succumbed to pressure from the United States that was campaigning for a worldwide law against drugs and in 1985 India passed the controversial NDPS—Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act—which banned the production and sale of cannabis resin and flowers but permitted the use of its leaves and seeds. Today marijuana is criminalised and few people are willing to go on record and admit to using it. But we found one guy a 60-year-old man who agreed to explain what it was like smoking weed in India before criminalisation. He talks about everything—from how he contacted dealers in the absence of mobile phones to sharing a chillum with the cops.

But turns out even a small crack on your screen protector can do a lot more damage than meets the eye. At least that’s what a Malaysian man found out the hard way when he continued to use a cracked screen protector to play games on his phone and ended up developing an infection. Although there was no visible wound the doctor diagnosed him with a bacterial infection and put him on a course of antibiotics. But the pain worsened and eventually he ended up in a private hospital.

157,,,Ever since the unrest erupted in June protesters have relied heavily on the use of technology to push their agenda and get more people to join the movement. It began with messages being relayed through groups on the messaging service Telegram while others hit each other up on the gaming platform Twitch. But now that violence levels have shot up police are cracking down on these platforms prompting protesters to think of out-of-the-box ideas to ensure that the movement lives on. Asking all those who swipe right on Tinder to do the right thing and join the movement is one of them while claiming that large groups of people are actually meeting up to play Pokemon GO instead of protest is another excuse.

160,,,The Indian government on Monday August 5 introduced a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to revoke Article 370 which confers special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir despite uproar from the Opposition. In a bid to fully integrate its only Muslim-majority region with the rest of the country this is the most far-reaching move the troubled Himalayan territory has seen in nearly seven decades. Home Minister Amit Shah also moved a bill to bifurcate the state into two union territories—Jammu Kashmir as one and Ladakh as the other. This move comes against the backdrop of an internet blockade and communication blackout in Kashmir since last night. Top political leaders in the state have also been placed under house arrest.

161,,,Like most of India it's a norm rather than an exception to grow up homophobic. We've lived in our bubbles where cis-gendered hetero identity is assumed to be 'normal' and calling someone 'gay' for either being too effeminate (for men) or not effeminate enough (for women) is even more so. So what happens when you decide to face your own internalised homophobia? Internalised homophobia is an involuntary bias and hatred towards LGBTQ community and it's often difficult to trace where exactly it stemmed from. But it's important to note that it often draws from an individual's own incomplete (and often hate-filled) sense of self which is made worse by the extreme environment of stigma and shame Indians already live in. We dived into a personal account of what it's like to face your homophobic past and make a journey of acceptance and self-love.

166,,,India is a country where everything from government office pens to train toilet mugs come with strings attached for one simple reason: We’re used to getting our way. But ever since an Indian family got busted in the act of stealing pretty much every amenity—from a hairdryer and hangers to a mirror and towels—from a hotel in Bali everyone on the internet is losing their shit at Indians who get down to all kinds of embarrassing things in a foreign land. And while the Chinese have consecutively been ranked as the world's worst tourists for six years it looks like India might overtake them for the first rank this year.

167,,,The billion-dollar Instagram influencer business’ upward crawl may just be now inching downwards. While recent studies suggest that influencer engagement is at an all-time low others reveal that many of them have millions of fake followers. All this at a time when Instagram is considering ‘hiding’ its likes so that the focus shifts away from public displays of validation to putting your best stuff out there. Alongside content fatigue appears to be setting in and you’re probably guilty of letting a yawn or two escape as you scroll through a feed filled with the same old stuff over and over again whether it’s done-to-death makeup tutorials or underwater footage from the Maldives. But what does this mean for the future of the industry? Is the blogger bubble about to burst?

169,,,Drag as an art performance is fairly new in India where the LGBTQ+ community is still met with ridicule ostracisation and confusion. At this juncture the drag queens bringing down the scene are not just fabulous but fiercely political. So while the queens are busy shaking boundaries of gender and sexuality what happens when they decide to experience love sex and relationship? Turns out that dating as a queen can reveal some really potent reminders of ingrained toxic masculinity and femmephobia (fear/hatred for all people and things that are perceived feminine) even in the LGBTQ community. We spoke to a few to find out why dating in India is so messed up. Link in bio. #LGBTQ #Sex #Love #Relationships,lgbtq sex love relationships,"|Lovely 😊💖|Ye logo ko kya hua hai???

170,,,"In addition to food the cafes of Rishikesh also do brisk trade in Beatles nostalgia. The story of the restaurant colloquially called the Beatles Cafe is a particular lesson in the power of a good brand.  The restaurant opened eight years ago as Cafe Delmar and was bought by a consortium of five people in 2011. According to the manager of the restaurant Mathur Bairangi market research by the owners made them realise that most tourists come to Rishikesh because of the Beatles. 
After they changed the name “business boomed” Bairagi said. The menu went through a rebranding too. Drinks became “The Green Revolution” and the tofu roll became “John Lennon Roll”. The menu bt dubs prices these items really fairly expensively. The idea was so profitable in fact that the owners used the same theme for another restaurant in another part of Rishikesh called “60’s The Eat Story”.

174,,,"India’s southern state of Tamil Nadu has long been characterised by its mountains its proximity to the Indian Ocean and the many Hindu temples which dot the southernmost part of the Indian subcontinent. But another distinguishing force is coming into play. Over the last two decades an influx of Japanese expatriates has slowly coloured the area’s culture and landscape. According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP) the relationship between the two regions can be traced back to the early 1990s when India first opened its market to global companies. Japanese firms such as Mitsubishi Motors Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Motor Corporation were quick to jump at the opportunity to establish themselves across the Indian subcontinent. This is particularly applicable to Tamil Nadu now one of the world’s top ten car manufacturing locales.
The South Indian state is now home to over a fifth of the 1000 Japanese businesses dotted across India. This is partly because Chennai is the second-largest port in the country and its Ennore neighborhood situated on a peninsula was developed specifically for Japanese businesses and exports to flourish in. The relationship shared between the neighborhood and Japan has been critical for Japanese investors who are now diversifying their interests in Tamil Nadu across a number of sectors such as shipping ports airlines or industrial parks. A deeper cultural exchange could just be around the corner for these two regions. Especially as tourism between Chennai and Japan is projected to experience a boost in the coming years. All Nippon Airways Japan’s largest airline will have daily direct flights between Chennai and Japan beginning in October. #TamilNadu #Culture #Japan",tamilnadu culture japan,|What I have to go to tamilnadu now|@madhu_2509|South>>>>>>>>>>>north.

Weed especially in North India is highly adulterated and consequentially affects the stigmas and taboos that surround this beautiful plant. The society will remain unenlightened and will continue to judge marijuana and hypocritically allow the legitimised use of drugs like alcohol and tobacco. The government suppresses the legalization efforts because it is aware of the constructive benefits the edification awareness and the harmonious objective of mutual benefits that stoners and pot users are known to harbor. As a lawyer I fervently support this drive and eagerly want the society to quit with them judgements and decriminalize it so that people can be more woke and harmless. @great.legalisation.movement|@panshul_chandra|@_phani_k_|@gaganshetty_ welcome to bhosdi baba talks|Yeah ans fucking destroy the youth...

This decision was taken while the apex court was trying to find a way to deal with the “alarming rise” in child rape cases in the country. This decision was taken as part of a whole host of suggestions made by Senior Advocate V Giri as an Amicus Curae or ‘friend of the court’ which also includes setting up a separate court to only deal with sexual offences against children effectively under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act within 60 days.

181,,,The damaging impact of fairness creams has now led to a crackdown on local and international cosmetics companies in Pakistan. The reason: They have been found with an excessive amount of mercury. The country's Ministry of Climate Change has recorded over 50 skin whitening creams in Pakistan are too dangerous which will potentially lead to sealing of companies' manufacturing after December 31 along with legal action. South Asia is known for its obsession with skin-whitening creams because of reasons ranging from our history of colonisation to the ongoing trend of white supremacy.

186,,,There were a few hiccups in the process but India’s much-awaited space mission to the moon Chandrayaan-2 has finally had lift-off. The launch which happened on July 22 is monumental for a number of reasons including the fact that for the first time in Indian history a space mission is spearheaded by two women. Chandrayaan-2 is led by Muthayya Vanitha and Ritu Karidhal the project director and mission director respectively. Vanitha has been with the ISRO for 32 years while Karidhal has worked there for 22. Both women have expertise in engineering and were fundamental to the planning and execution of this mission. Thirty percent of the team working on the project are women. Vanitha and Karidhal’s leadership is particularly notable because space travel has long ignored the contributions of women. However a recent string of films and articles have brought these stories to light. Of the 537 space travelers worldwide only 11 percent were women according to a 2016 study. #chandrayaan2 #ISRO #Space #Moon #WomenOfIndia #womenempowerment,chandrayaan2 isro space moon womenofindia womenempowerment,|Good|😍|❤️|@renegadef0rlife  Mera bharat mahaan|🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻|😍,4257

189,,,It's 2019 but Indian women are still fighting to gain agency over their own bodies. Today we look at the abortion rights in India after a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) at the Supreme Court last week found resonance among many. The PIL seeks decriminalisation of abortion and demands that women get full autonomy to make reproductive choices. The petition especially notes how the current law completely excludes unmarried women leading to far more discrimination and vulnerability. So VICE struck up a conversation with Paulomi Bose (name changed to protect privacy) who broke down the reality of (a) being unmarried (b) getting pregnant and (c) getting an abortion in India.

195,,,"A United Nations investigator has likened the living conditions of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar to that of concentration camps in Nazi-occupied Europe. Christopher Sidoti a member of the UN’s team for fact-finding on crimes against the Rohingya has brought forth new allegations which illustrate just how severe the circumstances are.
“These are concentration camps – let’s call it what it is – with 128000 internally displaced people in central Rakhine” said Sidoti at University College London’s conference on the Rohingya crisis.
Sidoti went on to describe the camps as “urban ghettos like those Jews lived in under Nazi-occupied Europe.” He said that the “genocidal intent” of the military has only risen in the past few years.

196,,,Considering that countries around the world are decriminalising the use of marijuana especially for medical purposes and even legalising it for personal blazing sessions many feel it’s high time India decriminalises the “drug” as well. Now a new petition filed in the Delhi High Court is challenging the prohibition and criminalisation of cannabis in the country emphasising its medical benefits and suggesting that industrial hemp can help the farmers' economy. This is the third such petition but this time there are high hopes that it all may work out.

198,,,"Recent surveys have shown that the majority of Indians are meat-eaters but looks like vegetarianism could be fighting to expand its definition in India. Earlier this week Sanjay Raut—a Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP—urged the Rajya Sabha to consider classifying chicken and eggs as vegetarian food items. He also claimed that researchers in northern India are working on ""ayurvedic eggs"": the eggs that are produced if you feed chicken ayurvedic food. Will his statement fuel the whole 'India is a vegetarian country' debate or will it just spark yet another hipster trend (think turmeric latte) on phony health cafe menus?

The crisis brings forth a paradox according to CNN. As overall rain has decreased in the continent the extreme rainfall has increased in frequency. The combination of the two has brought forth both drought and flooding respectively. The decline in rainfall has primarily been caused by the warming of the Indian Ocean air pollution and change in land usage.
In India and Nepal almost 100 people have died from rising flood waters this year. In Bangladesh the monsoons have wiped out Rohingya refugee camps and cut off vital transit routes. Over 100 people have died of a heat wave in India. While in Afghanistan millions of people have felt the impact of drought bringing starvation and displacement to those living in farming areas.

201,,,Identifying as a bisexual can be a difficult journey in India. While coming out as a queer person brings with it its own set of challenges being bisexual is even more difficult. There's the discrimination that comes from biphobia and also the fact that bisexuals are treated with suspicion. A dominant stereotype around bisexuals is that they're either not capable of commitment or are confused or just plain greedy for sex. There's also a tendency for men to think that bisexual women will be up for a threesome by default. Is India ready to have a conversation about this lack of acceptance be it outside or within the community? Find out more about what it's like to be a bisexual in India on the link in bio.

202,,,Even as the monsoons continue to devastate South Asia the floods in Assam have got so bad that 90 percent of the Kaziranga National Park is reportedly submerged underwater. The World Heritage Site which covers an area of 430 sq km is home to the highest number of Indian one-horned rhinoceroses Asiatic water buffaloes and Eastern Swamp Deer and also houses other animals like tigers elephants and wild boars. The floods have taken such a heavy toll on the animals that many are crossing over into the highlands and human-inhabited areas to save themselves.

204,,,Even as Indian courts endorse inter-caste marriage to kill the caste system about 800 members of Gujarat's Thakor community got together and decided in a meeting on July 12 that they wouldn’t tolerate anyone marrying outside the community. This rule is so strict that they’re even imposing fines on the families of those who violate the community code and have also decided to ban unmarried girls from using their mobile phones. What’s even more concerning is that the local Congress MLA Geniben Thakor who also belongs to the community is supportive of this and feels that mobile phones should be taken away from girls to prevent them from eloping. “This will automatically control boys. Since girls are easily controlled because they stay with parents it is right to ban (mobile phone use among) girls” she said.

208,,,In India learning about the birds and the bees can be difficult. While most attitudes are shaped by morality and conservative mindsets there is also the absence of sex education or making it available to same-sex groups. Research shows that the leading source of our sex ed is porn. And most porn websites in India are mostly hetero with only about 5-15% catering to LGBTQ viewers (and available mostly in niche or gay-specific websites). So where does the LGBTQ community find its sexual awakening? We reached out to a few people to find out.

214,,,"India’s ambitions of landing an unmanned rover on the moon have been momentarily delayed after a technical glitch caused the mission to be put on hold less than an hour before take off.

The country’s Chandrayaan 2 spacecraft was scheduled to launch at 2:51 this morning local time from Sriharikota space centre near Chennai—marking India’s first attempt at a moon landing. But the countdown clock was stopped with just over 56 minutes to go and a media feed from the Sriharikota control room was cut off before the launch was ultimately abandoned for the day The Guardian reports.

On 1 hand I condone this behavior on another  I can see their hatred for India. Before you go ahead and give me examples of Kashmiri pandits. I have to tell you that I grew up in a similar region of india as well unlike most of you who are commenting here as if Kashmir is in your backyard. Similar unrest and oppression was prevalent in Assam. Growing up I thought bombs blast curfews terror attacks bandhs were just normal events like festivals. Cause it was that frequent. Having to pass through army check posts every 10kms each time I visited my grandmom was not normal. The only reason we(meaning my dad) was let go with less hassle because he had a woman and a child with him. There multiple instances I can point out that I narrowly escaped a bomb blast. I'm not sure how many of you can say that or relate to it. Being raised in such an environment changes your mindset a lot. With not enough education and job opportunities for the youth back then. Of course a lot of them went into militancy. Luckily we didn't have a religion divide which could've been weaponized by politicians. But yes people( regular civilians and militants) did want a separate country because they said we weren't represented in the national level properly and even development wasn't at par which is still true for the whole Northeast. There were so many secret killings. State sponsored ex-terrorists would visit families in the dead of the night and take away innocent families relatives and sometimes ULFA sympathizers and shoot them. Almost 400 people were killed between 1998-2001. Luckily the next CM refused to continue the killings inspite of orders from Center and brought new surrender policies which helped. The Minister responsible for carrying out the killings was given a clean chit. Imagine the anger or hatred they must've pent up for the Govt. You see some communities across India have been systematically kept away from development and opportunities. If the govt. of a state wants to sort out the issue they can. But they won't. So please don't go around blurting around the lies which the biased media fed you.|BEING A KASHMIRI MYSELF THIS IS NOTHING NEW @viceindia THE SAME CELEBRATIONS WOULD CONVERT INTO PROCESSIONS THAT ATTACKED HINDUS IN THE PAST.

221,,,"Sabyasachi Mukherjee an Indian fashion designer has been described as the “king of India’s bridal market”. Now the designer is under the stern gaze of Indian consumers and media for his latest campaign’s comments on women.“Some women find jewellery filling in the gaps and echoing the silences in their lives hoping their everlasting sparkle rubs off a little magic on to their restless souls” reads a caption in the photo series for Sabyasachi Jewellery. ""If you see a woman ‘overdressed’ caked with makeup armored with jewellery it is most likely that she is wounded. Bleeding inside silently” another post claims. Many have taken umbrage at how this campaign positions women. Some critiqued the need to explain why women choose to dress up. Some condemned the romanticizing of a woman’s emotional state in order to sell an image and jewelry. Others believed the sentiment behind the campaign was purely commercial. The backlash also indicates a growing resistance to the double standards and stereotypes Indian women find themselves facing in various ways on a daily basis. Social media in particular is amplifying India’s efforts to fight back against many of its patriarchal norms. The campaign’s blowback compelled Sabyasachi to release his own statement which attempted to explain the true intent of his campaign. “We as a society often get extremely judgemental about peoples’ clothing choices. We fail to understand that maybe some are using these as coping mechanisms to put on a brave front to make up for the lack of a support system” he wrote.

222,,,Only a few days after the tragic death of a 25-year-old in Myanmar who was bullied by his colleagues we got the shocking news of the death by suicide of Mumbai-born Avi Patel who ended his life on July 2 at the age of 20. His suicide was brought to the public limelight because of the heartbreaking post he left on Facebook before taking his life. He wrote the post in Hindi and English appealing to those reading that he was fed up of people bullying him for being effeminate. In the post he asks his friends to look after his parents and in the same vein rebukes his orientation mentioning that he wonders why God made him gay. For several queer Indian youth growing up means developing a thick skin against bullies. But not everyone gets past them.

Will this help prevent the spread of HIV to an unsuspecting spouse or does it violate individual rights? Can it lead to social isolation if someone tests positive?

227,,,Ever since Section 377 was repealed on September 6 2018 the Indian LGBTQ+ community has been free to love and make love to whomever they please. Except despite the increased visibility of pride parades the stigma that is rampant in our society means that the queer community still doesn’t hold equal rights especially when it comes to marriage adoption and inheritance. In an effort to change this advocates Tajinder Singh and Anurag Chauhan filed a plea in the Delhi High Court (HC) asking for laws and regulations to be created for the community to recognise their relationships allow them to get married or divorced and adopt a kid. However on Monday July 8 the Delhi HC declined to entertain this plea and said that drafting laws for such reform was the responsibility of the Legislature.

In case he has to regrettably cancel an event because his practice was not understood the way he would have preferred then that is his prerogative.

In Swaminarayan Sampradaya women are made to sit behind men in spiritual discourses and that is done as an act of devotion and respect.

You will get to know the truth. Please check the facts & post. Don't spread hate & false statements.|Dear sir
Pujya Gyanvatsal Swami is a mechanical engineer. He is a saint of BAPS swaminarayan sanstha an NGO that has a permanent seat in the United Nation organisation. They’re also a part of Guiness book of world records because the former head of the organisation built the most number of Hindu temples around the globe. 
Majority of the saints of the organisation have completed their education from Harvard Oxford Yale’s Univeristy. Many of them have left their $100000 salary and have taken Diksha. They don’t allow any educated person below the age of 21 to take Diksha. 
May I please get your facts clear that the Akshardham temple at Ahmedabad and New Delhi is also built by this sanstha. Also the first Hindu temple in the Middle East (Abu Dhabi)  is being constructed by this organisation. Hon Prime minister of India Narendra Modi had attended the stone laying ceremony at Abu Dhabi. 
Before taking diksha these saints are supposed to undergo a training for 3 years at Sarangpur Gujarat. It is a part of their religion ethic that they should avoid making any contact with a women. If they make any contact directly/indirectly they have to fast for 24hrs.

May I please request you to get your facts clear before making any post on your social media platform since this brings a false impression  about them in the minds of common people. 
Also may I please request you to post an apology post on your story since your post has attracted a lot of hatred for the saint. 
Lastly I hope that you get your facts cleared before posting things on your social media platforms.

Thanking you

Before posting content  you’re supposed to do research. This is expected out of a page that had so many followers. But unfortunately you failed at posting REAL content. 
Posting stories without verifying them or even understanding the sensitivity of the moment is not cool. You just lost out on a bunch of followers when they realize how false and misleading you post is.
These swamis are very educated and give up on a lot of things. They take Sanyaas and hence do not see the face of any person of the opposite sex. 
Had this been the other way round and if a woman saint wished to not see the men’s faces. She would have been respected. 
Understand what culture and norms a saint follows and what all do they have to give up in life Writing your stories ✌️

Being sanyasi they’ve taken vow of giving up all kinds of Moh-Maya. They DO NOT SEE WOMEN they don’t touch money they don’t consume outside food.& also they don’t consume onion/garlic. They dedicate their whole life to God Swaminarayan & serving society up to their capacity. And women being a type of Moh- Maya for men they don’t see or even look at women. If they see a women by mistake they observe a fast without water & food for 24 hours. & coming to this scene gyanvatsal swami being saint 1st & then a motivational speaker couldn’t speak as women were sitting in front rows & that was against of what they’ve been doing.

234,,,Sadam Hanjabam's introduction to chemsex was in 2017 when a Grindr ping led him to experiment with a meth-laced cigarette. This was the beginning of Hanjabam's journey into the underground chemsex scene in India followed by addiction abuse overdose and eventually attempted suicide. Chemsex is a term used for male sex parties often fuelled by usage of mephedrone G and crystal meth. However in this underground world gay men often end up with drug abuse and AIDS. And with the physical distress comes an equally distressing ordeal of discrimination as both a queer person and a drug abuser both from within and outside the queer community.

236,,,On July 3 the Indian government took a pretty tough stand against a Public Interest Litigation which wanted the rape laws to be gender-neutral. At the moment Indian Penal Code's Section 375 and 376 defines victims of sexual assault and crime as women and perpetrators as men. Over the last few years we've seen similar calls for gender-neutral justice systems especially during #MeToo since 2017 and the #MenToo activism. However in a country that has some really disturbing stats on crimes against women the central government's stance acknowledges the fact that victims of sexual harassment are mostly women and perpetrators mostly men.

How pathetic it is to treat victims of sexual abuse as merely numbers! The number shouldn't matter - even if one man/boy is abused treat the person as someone who deserves justice and not as ""doesn't happen too many times"".

243,,,In a scene that haunts the citizens of Mumbai every year the streets today are waterlogged train stations flooded with water instead of people drains choked up and flights either diverted or delayed. At least 23 people were killed over the last two days in rain-related incidents prompting the government to declare a holiday today as a precautionary measure. Even as citizens call out the municipality department for their lack of planning according to Mumbai municipal chief Praveen Pardeshi it is not bad infrastructural planning but climate change that is responsible for bringing the city to a standstill.

What they do is simply make a hole in a ground and they store the flood water underground and when the flood is over the same water which they proceed and retain.

And it’s no different in India. This #WorldDrugDay the United Nations released the 2019 World Drug Report and estimates that drug use in India has gone up by 30%.

254,,,In South Asia being queer comes not only with lack of visibility but also stereotypes violence and discrimination. And in the Muslim-majority nation of Pakistan—where the laws have criminalised homosexuality and where consensual sex between individuals of the same sex is illegal—queer politics is not only sidelined to the fringes of the society but is constantly in threat too. This is why when Pakistani artists Aziz Sohail (@azizisohail) Abdullah Qureshi (@maq39) and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr (@zulfikaralibhutto) got together it became a significant breakthrough in the LGBTQ movement in and outside their country. Through their work they talk about sexuality and queerness in the context of being not just Muslim but also Pakistanis at a time when Islamophobia has become a global crisis. VICE spoke with them on their work and lives.

257,,,A 26-year-old madrasa teacher in West Bengal was beaten up and pushed off a moving train last Thursday when a group demanded he chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and he refused.

266,,,In an order on June 18 the Madras High Court endorsed intercaste marriages saying it is the only solution to fix the evils of our caste system. It's no secret that marriages between people of different castes are still a big taboo in India and honour killings are the most problematic outcome of it. A recent survey by National Crime Records Bureau calculated some 77 murder cases in just 2016 that had honour killing as a motive. In fact a recent study also observed that majority of Indians are anti-intercaste and interreligious marriages. Which is why the Madras HC encouraging intercaste marriages is a big step forward in not just challenging the social ostracisation and crimes associated with it but also highlighting basic fundamental rights.

Bussa Krishna a 32-year-old farmer from the Jangaon district of Telangana who likes to call himself Donald Trump’s ‘biggest fan’ went all out to celebrate the President of the United States’ 73rd birthday on June 14 by building a six feet tall statue of Trump. Saying he was an admirer of Trump’s “bold attitude” and “strong leadership” this guy even hosted a special unveiling ceremony for it. This included a ritual known as ‘abhishek’ where he poured milk onto the statue the way one would normally do for deities while chanting “Jai Jai Trump”. He even gave him a tilak and garland at the celebration he hosted in a tent filled with posters wishing the POTUS a happy birthday. He’s also convinced that worshipping Trump is what made India win the recent World Cup match and can improve the country’s relations with the US.

For the next one week doctors across the country walked out of their hospitals in a country-wide strike saying they've had enough.

275,,,"On June 16 the Bombay high court declared that casually touching a colleague does not constitute a case of outraging the modesty of a woman. This order has came in light of a case in which the principal of an ashram school in Maharashtra was booked under Section 354 of Indian Penal Code for touching the hands of a teacher in the class. In a post-#MeToo country we are still trying to grapple with what constitutes crossing the line. And given that last week the Mumbai Police closed the very case that triggered #MeToo in India—in which actress Tanushree Dutta filed a complaint against co-star Nana Patekar for molesting and harassing her in 2010—saying there wasn't enough ""evidence"" to prove the accused was guilty we can't help but wonder: Does this court order give more definition to understanding what sexual harassment is or does it make it easier for the accused to get away with bad behaviour?

276,,,What's a cricket match if not defined by its fans? On June 16 the cricket World Cup match between India and Pakistan ended on a high note for the Indian team who won by 89 runs. And as fans from both sides of the border reacted passionately some Pakistani fans decided to vent their anguish over the loss of their country through humour (or so we think). One of the reactions included some of them blaming the team’s diet of burgers and dessert as the culprit for the loss. As social media goes through a post-match meltdown we look at why in the two most cricket-obsessed countries it's hard to tell how much of this is just fans joking or if they truly believe their own reasoning. Something tells us it's the latter.

The Drugs Technical Advisory Board of India seems to think so. This is why they have approved a proposal to regulate Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (or ENDS) which includes vapes by classifying them as “drugs” and cancelling them from being sold in the country.

In her last video Anitha is seen gulping down dark-coloured poison from a white bottle. She then sent the video to her husband over WhatsApp but soon after broke into a coughing fit and died.

Because hey if you can complete an obstacle course on an office chair without falling smack on your face you’re already winning at life. The race consists of teams of three battling it out for two back-breaking hours to complete the most laps in a 200 metre course.

In India air pollution has taken over our news resulted in country-wide movements and right now it’s staring us in the face with vengeance. At this point Bengaluru-based journalist Aruna Chandrasekhar and Delhi-based photographer Ishan Tankha (@ishantankha)have brought together a project aptly titled Breathless to talk about air pollution in India. They travelled across eight cities some of which have been listed as the most polluted in the world. The photographs show us not just how air pollution takes shape visibly but also the human cost of it all. These stories are about survivors of diseases and their fight against polluters.

I'd like people who are complaining about the brownface to spend time out in the sun and pollution to see what effect that takes on your face.

Based on the actors speciality production house demand popularity etc.. if you see akshay kumar in padman the real person Mr A Muruganantham is a short highted dark man and the actor is a Tall fair punjabi guy.

The idea is to portray a role and she did it really well so did ranveer Singh. So please ffs stop calling it racism and focus on topics which actually will help address the issues.|This is really stupid an issue. If colouring yourself blue is ok then brown black or white is ok too. It’s called acting. I don’t see an issue with it. Acting isn’t about finding the correct skin toned actor for every role.

You guys are supposed to be the sensible ones. In Super 30 hrithik roshan is playing a real life person and the darkening of the skin is to match that person's complexion! And regarding alia Bhatt it's not about being poor= being dark. It's about being poor leads to more manual work in less than proper environment which leads to less self care. It's that. Just that. We reach out to you guys to get good perspective on things. Not to see opinions taken out of context.|I don't think it has anything to do with racism. It has more to do with the fact that a labourer or someone who lives in the slums would be more likely to come in contact to sunlight which may make them more tan. You are over thinking it. Imo 🤷. Also ""brown face"" isn't really a thing. ""Black face"" however is as it was used in the past by whites to mock or insult black people in movies. By painting their face black and making their lips bigger with make up and portraying them as clowns.

294,,,Beef might be banned in several Indian states but West Bengal is not one of them. So when Arjun Kar—founder of an event management company —posted on Facebook asking his friends if they would come for a “crazy meat extravaganza” and the RSVPs poured in he decided to organise the Kolkata Beef Festival. The festival was scheduled to be held on June 23 and promised to serve up dishes like tenderloin beef bolognese and other dishes that aren’t too common in Kolkata. What they got instead were calls and comments from people hating on the idea that a food festival could be fashioned around beef. They first tried to reason with them and even renamed the event to ‘Kolkata Beep* Festival’. But even turning the festival’s theme into censored slang wasn’t enough to appease the offended.

298,,,"Last year the #MeToo movement did many things: from highlighting toxic workplaces to sexual misconduct to how to take legal action against the perpetrators. But #MeToo also received endless backlash and mockery including from celebrities such as Pooja Bedi and Alok Nath. However the most relentless backlash has been coming from the men's rights activists (MRA). Active since the early 2000s the MRAs are now angrier than ever. Their reason: laws that apparently protect women are built to harm men. We get inside the world of these ""meninists""—who have now found support from a regulatory body of lawyers in New Delhi—and find out why #MeToo has triggered a whole new #MenToo activism.

Not saying everyone needs to be spiritual or denounce social norms just saying we won’t need factions if we step back and out of our egos and work on root cause. ✨. The negative lens can be put on anything laws that are there to protect women are there because women are often subjected to harm and haven’t had a voice in patriarchal cultures. The laws are there so that they can find their voice until laws are no longer needed. It’s not anti-men it’s pro-humanity to promote equality. So that people can speak up for themselves when there’s injustice and all anyone ever asks for is support when they’re speaking up and choosing vulnerability and courage over fear obscurity and suffering. We all need to choose to need end hate mongering. That’s not what our culture should be.

Three years is no simple feat and the school has a strict interview process to vet potential candidates before they embark on the journey. During the interview applicants will have to fast for anywhere from one to two weeks. If they pass the test they start fasting for three years three months three weeks and three days straight.
Those who successfully complete the fasting will receive the blessing of the Islamic school and according to their beliefs will be closer to God. The school's students come from nearly every walk of life from young teenage students to grown truck drivers businessmen and civil servants.

319,,,As South Korea moves towards scrapping the law that allows parents to physically discipline their kids many parents in the country are trying to oppose it and it’s causing quite the controversy. According to estimates reports of child abuse in the country—including neglect and emotional abuse along with physical or sexual assaults—have risen more than tenfold between 2001 and 2017 with 77 per cent of cases seeing the abuse inflicted by the victims' parents. And even though studies depict their traumatising effects on a child’s development and mental health Korean parents aren’t ready to do away with corporal punishment. We want to know what you think: whether parents should be legally barred from spanking kids to discipline them or as the adage goes 'spare the rod spoil the child'.

320,,,It’s only been a few days since the outcome of one of India’s most crucial elections but the beefs have already begun. A well-known Adivasi activist and professor in the village of Sakchi in Jharkhand’s Jamshedpur district Jeetrai Hansda has been arrested for a 2017 Facebook post where he spoke about how eating beef was a tradition and right for his community. While the complaint is said to have been filed in 2017 by the Akhil Bharati Vidyarthi Parishad—the student wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Hansda’s lawyer said that the BJP waited until after the election to arrest him so they wouldn’t lose the Adivasi votebank.

321,,,A majority of judges on Brazil’s Supreme Court voted Thursday to make homophobia and transphobia a crime marking a major victory for the country’s LGBT population as they face an increasingly threatening environment with dozens of people having been killed this year and President Jair Bolsonaro proudly declaring his dislike of the community. The protection is needed as it’s a dangerous time for LGBT people in Brazil: At least 141 LGBT people have been killed so far in 2019 the Associated Pressreports citing a watchdog group. Meanwhile President Bolsonaro has said he’s proud of his homophobia. The president has declared in interviews that he’d rather have a dead son than a gay son and that Brazil must not become a “gay tourism paradise.” “If you want to come here and have sex with a woman go for your life” Bolsonaro told journalists in April. “But we can’t let this place become known as a gay tourism paradise. Brazil can’t be a country of the gay world of gay tourism. We have families.” #Brazil #Homophobia #lgbtq🌈 #gayrights #SupremeCourt,brazil homophobia lgbtq gayrights supremecourt,|I wonder what Bolsonaro must be feeling right now 😂|🙌❤️❤️|Stare enforced homosexuality|F4f look my post 😈😜|Too much of anything is not good.......

334,,,"In London last month activists from Extinction Rebellion (XR) launched an unusual attack on the streets—gluing breasts to the streets staging ""die-ins"" and chaining their necks to fences. Over 1000 protestors were arrested but the UK Parliament also declared a climate emergency. In India though it's tough enough to get a group of people pissed off over climate threat let alone go to extremes to voice its dangers. But the young India chapter of XR is trying to change that. In a country known for famously not giving a shit about our dying cities rivers and agrarian crisis will XR make people care?

340,,,"Google recently dropped over 50 gender-fluid emojis even featuring a gender-ambiguous zombie vampire and merpeople. Emojis have gotten a major overhaul from the 176 that were originally released back in 1999 to more than 3000 today. But while the OG emojis went from being yellow like they were straight outta Simpsons to embracing a range of colours major changes were also made to skin tones and sexual orientations. So while we now have same-sex couples and dark-skinned praying signs nothing related to gender really saw much change. Which is why in a world that grows increasingly aware about gender ambiguity Google’s newest emojis are an attempt to appreciate. Head to the link in bio to see what makes them stand out.

344,,,"Bengaluru has been predicted as becoming 'unlivable' by 2025. But there to hopefully save the day is a community of hard-working well-diggers. The Mannuvadar community the traditional well-diggers from Karnataka have watched in agony as over the last few years Bengaluru dried up around them. For generations this community has been famous for “sniffing out” the best spots to dig for water in Karnataka—their deep understanding of the soil and the bedrock allows them to get an accurate sense of where the water is likely to be closer to the ground. While machine-drilled borewells took over their jobs in the past couple of decades the city is again turning to them to quench its thirst. Click on the link in bio to know more.

The rate at which geoundwater is being extracted is way higher than the recharge rates by the overall perecipitation of the city. 80% of the water allocated in the city comes from ruver cauvery.. 51 % of which is  allocated for domestic use and the remain 49% for industries and others... 25% of the water out of this 49 is going out as what BWSSB calls it physical loss.. meaning leaks due to poorly maintained allocation channels. Industries claim to use only about 2% of water out of 49. What's sad is that BWSSB doesnot have any idea about where the rest of the water (22%) go. The number may seem small but it's millions of litres of water we're talking about! We did a whole project of the semester term paper to analyse how urbanization has resulted in climate change (rainfall and run offs). Imagine if bangalore has better channelising and the people move towards being water suoply driven and not demand driven. Digging up wells may seem like a good option now..

345,,,It’s not illegal to be gay in the Indonesian city of Padang but in the past six weeks as many as 18 LGBT couples have been apprehended for “psychological support and rehabilitation”. That was the term employed by the Civil Services Police. According to the BBC Indonesia though “support and rehabilitation” ultimately means an exorcism utilised as gay conversion therapy.  In Indonesia exorcisms are performed as a component of Islamic faith known as ruqyah which is used to treat all kinds of maladies: be they arthritis asthma business failure or insomnia. In the context of conversion therapy it's believed that LGBT individuals can be cured of their “social sickness” by weeding out malevolent spirits and demons known as djinn. It is the view of many people in Padang—including the city’s mayor Mahyeldi Ansharullah—that gay and transgender people are suffering from a kind of mental illness. The only way to cure them they say is through ruqyah.  While these kinds of homophobic attitudes are not prevalent throughout Indonesia thousands of residents in Padang have recently rallied in favour of the initiatives that the local government is pushing—to “fight immorality in the city” as Mayor Ansharullah recently put it. #Indonesia #LGBTQ,indonesia lgbtq,|Hey bhagwan 😩|Okay but what the fuck is that photo,749

What this means is that while the law stipulates that anyone caught engaging in homosexuality in Brunei is to face capital punishment such measures will never be carried out in practice. Similarly while executions have long been permitted as punishment for crimes such as premeditated murder and drug trafficking in the country none have actually taken place since 1957. ""Both the common law and the Syariah [sharia] law aim to ensure peace and harmony of the country"" he declared in his speech yesterday.

But what's worse is that the number of such cases have increased after the Supreme Court's landmark #Section377 judgment that decriminalised sex between same-sex couples. Whereas the community previously lived in the fear of being outed nowadays they live in the fear of being beaten up for embracing who they truly are.

364,,,Haters gonna hate and potatoes gonna potate but in this week’s developments the two phrases seemingly came together. Earlier this week PepsiCo Holdings tried to sue four farmers in Gujarat over the intellectual property rights of a (drum roll please) potato! They claimed that they have been growing a variety of potatoes that has been exclusively copyrighted by the company for their Lay's chips. However after facing immense pressure and criticism from farmers’ groups and activists and over social media PepsiCo Holdings has finally given in and offered a settlement.

372,,,The Siddis—an African-origin tribal community living in India's forests—are struggling to keep their homes. Spread across Karnataka Maharashtra and Gujarat the community was brought to the subcontinent as slaves by Indian merchants as early as the third century AD and retreated to the forests to escape harassment during the colonial times. Since then these forests have been both their home and a source of livelihood.

375,,,For the last few years Karnataka has been witnessing a large-scale movement led by rural women demanding a ban on alcohol. The movement gathered momentum in January 2019 when thousands of women marched from Chitradurga to Bengaluru (approximately a distance of 200 kilometres) to make themselves heard in the state’s capital and seat of power. But yet again their protests fell on deaf ears. Three months later with elections on NOTA seems to be the only recourse for the women suffering from the consequences of rampant alcoholism among men in rural areas. We speak with women across some villages to know whether NOTA can be an effective tool for protest. #Women #Karnataka #Alcohol #Elections #Ban #SouthIndia,women karnataka alcohol elections ban southindia,"|@great.legalisation.movement|Yes it can!|It happens in the cities as well.|Banning alcohol isn't the solution.

The kind of lobbying cannabis is receiving right now at least in political circles is headed by very few but powerful people the magnitude of cannabis that Indians consume is huge inspite of it being de jure illegal. Exceptions exist. My point is unless proper regulatory policies to make it available to all and not to the few. Regulation in pricing and standardisation of product all these things need mass participation to succeed. In India where farmers are under plight cannabis cultivation can answer multifaced problems. This is common knowledge but when policies don't withhold fundamental ideals results are invariably disappointingif not tragic. Today many on the web know about the collaboration between CSIR and the startup whose angel investors include scions of two of the most Respected and trusted business families in India. They have a truly inclusive vision and I admire that. But at the same time why aren't other startups allowed to trade? Why is Ramdev Baba the next best option? People in India are so unaware of their rights that they are often harassed by the law enforcement for consumption when the NDPS act does not criminalize mere 'consumption'. Legalizing it and leaving it to the hands of businessmen would never better the situation. How do you expect legalization to work in a society where the people believe that the state considers it ""CRIMINAL"".

On 29th November 2005 he was attending a family wedding in his native village when things took a deadly turn for him and those around.

सुप्रीमकोर्ट ने जिस समलैंगिकता को मान्यता दी है बह सभ्य समाज के लिये कलंक है 
सभ्य समाज के लिये कलंक तो है ही बल्कि इससे आम लोगो की मानसिकता पर भी बहुत गहरा असर पड़ेगा

परंपरागत तौर से भारत में समाज इस प्रकार के संबंधों को मान्यता नहीं देता है।
समलैंगिकता सभी धर्म के खिलाफ है।|#Homosexuality_Not_Accepted
अगर सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने समलैंगिकता के फैसले परपुनर्विचार नहीं किया तोयह फैसला भारतीय समाज व संस्कृति को पतन की ओर ले जाने का काम करेगा। क्योंकि समलैंगिकता भारतीय समाज में अशांति का कारण बनेगा।

सुप्रीम कोर्ट द्वारा समलैंगिक संबंधों से संबंधित #Section377 को खत्म कर देना भारतीय संस्कृति पर कुठराघात है । क्योकि यह एक मानसिक विकार है यह समलैंगिको की अपनी बनाई दुनिया है । जिस तरह सरकार द्वारा नशे जैसी बुराई को समाप्त करने के लिए नशा मुक्ति केन्द्र बनाए गए है उसी तरह इसके लिए भी विकल्प खोजना चाहिए न कि इसे लागू कर देना चाहिए ।
सत्संग एक ऐसा माध्यम है जिससे हम कई विकारों को त्याग सकते है । समलैंगिकता जैसी समस्याओं से निजात पाने के लिए जरुर सुने साधना टीवी पर 7:30 pm पर संत रामपाल जी महाराज जी के अनमोल सत्संग प्रवचन ।|समलैंगिकता समाज के लिए अभिशाप है। भारतीय संस्कृति की धमक पूरे विश्व में है। पूरी दुनिया भारतीय संस्कृति के आगे नतमस्तक है। ऐसे में भारत को अन्य देशों की कुरीतियों को अपनाकर दामन पर दाग नहीं लगाना चाहिए।
