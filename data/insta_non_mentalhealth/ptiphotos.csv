In 1990 the 11 young men founded DYWA and started sponsoring widows with Rs 100 a month. Then looking at low literacy rates and poverty in the area the group took another step - the library.

The collection boasts of rare works of Mughal era poets Mirza Ghalib Mohammed Ibrahim Zauq Momin Khan Momin as well as medieval Sufi treaties. #ptiphotos #library #readingroom #olddelhi #delhi #chandnichowk #mirzaghalib #persian #urdu #indianepics #ramayan #mahabharata #mughlaera #books #booknerdigan #instagram #bookgram #photooftheday #india #delhi",ptiphotos library readingroom olddelhi delhi chandnichowk mirzaghalib persian urdu indianepics ramayan mahabharata mughlaera books booknerdigan instagram bookgram photooftheday india delhi,|😄😄👍|Where this was located in delhi,181

Thirty-four years after thousands of lives were snuffed out at an instant on the intervening night of December 2-3 1984 the Bhopal gas tragedy continues to cast a shadow over the survivors of the world's worst industrial disaster. .

Rohit Jain a Delhi based documentary photographer has captured the grim pictures of disabled children and young adults in a photo project titled ‘Children disabilities:A forgotten case of Union Carbide’. A close look at the lives of the second and third generation of the victims who continue to inhabit the area around the Union Carbide India Limited plant from where the venomous gas leaked on a fateful night shows that while the disaster may have faded from popular memory its repercussions continue to haunt the survivors. #ptiphotos
