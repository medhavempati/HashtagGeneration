1,,,"At the edge of this galaxy in the bottom-right corner of this photograph is a Type Ia supernova called SN 2018gv – the bright white star with a blue halo.
.
The image was created with colour composites taken with the Hubble Space Telescope using optical and near-infrared filters. Researchers recently discovered that 150 days after it exploded this supernova continued to fade in the optical but remained fairly constant in the near-infrared for roughly an entire year!

2,,,"Quasicrystals are materials with an ordered structural pattern but unlike traditional crystals that pattern does not repeat.
.
In 2011 Prof Dan Shechtman won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery but other scientists have continued to study quasicrystal patterns. Now Prof Tomonari Dotera and colleagues in Japan and Slovenia have proposed a family of quasiperiodic tilings that can approximate a periodic appearance (Nature Communications: doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12147-z). They’re still quasicrystals but locally they behave like periodic crystals. In this image they’ve laid out one of the tiling patterns on the floor of the Academic Theater library at Kindai University.

3,,,"Researchers at UCLA have shown that a gut-living bacterium Turicibacter sanguinis interacts with its host to trigger increased serotonin production by intestinal cells which - in turn - helps create a more favourable environment for its own existence.
.
Serotonin - found mainly in the brain bowel and blood platelets - has a wide variety of functions in the body including a role in wellbeing. Chemicals that hinder re-uptake of serotonin at nerve junctions (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs) are used as anti-depressants. A large proportion of serotonin is made by hormone-producing cells in the intestinal lining.
.
Posting on the Nature Research Microbiology Community Elaine Hsiao describes how she and her team discovered that increased levels of serotonin in the intestines of mice led to an increase in T.sanguinis colonies: go.nature.com/2Zrpqxt (link in bio). The team found that the bacterium has a protein similar to human serotonin transporter protein and their detailed investigations showed that this protein enables T.sanguinis to detect and respond to serotonin. They also found that an SSRI impaired T.sanguinis colonisation in the gut.
.
The way in which T.sanguinis colonisation is influenced by serotonin - and also how it is affected by an SSRI anti-depressant - raise interesting questions about how this gut microbe might be involved in wider host biology. The research was published in Nature Microbiology (doi.org/10.1038/s41564-019-0540-4).

4,,,"The white-throated woodrat is highly skilled at handling its favourite food the prickly pear cactus; not such an easy task for researchers though as Dr Rodolfo Martinez-Mota tells us in his behind the paper post on the Nature Research Microbiology Community: go.nature.com/32Di2gc (link in bio). 🌵 .
The balance of gut bacteria in white-throated woodrats (Neotoma albigula) is tailored to help them break down toxins in the cacti they feed on. To test the effects of diet on gut microflora Rodolfo and colleagues from the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Utah caught a dozen woodrats near Castle Valley Utah and fed them on various diets of either commercial food or Opuntia cactus (prickly pear).
.
By isolating characterising and comparing bacteria in the woodrat droppings the researchers found that the woodrats fed on commercial chow lost more than a third of their native microbial communities whereas those fed on cactus retained 90%.
.
The lifestyle of animals kept in artificial environments can be very different from the wild and the communities of gut microorganisms in such animals is often affected with implications for health.  These results highlight the importance of ensuring the diets of animals in artificial environments contain wild-natural foods to help maintain gut microbiome diversity. The research paper was published recently in the ISME Journal (doi.org/10.1038/s41396-019-0497-6).

5,,,"The bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae flourishes in hospitals causing patient infections that can lead to sepsis. K. pneumoniae is already resistant to a number of antibiotics so infections are treated with Carbepenem but resistance to this last-line antibiotic is also rising rapidly.
.
Resistant K. pneumoniae are known to have modified channel proteins (called porins) in their outer membrane that prevent Carbepenem from getting inside. In a post on the Nature Research Microbiology Community (go.nature.com/30JcksJ – link in bio) Dr Joshua Wong outlines his work with colleagues at Imperial College London investigating two porins found in antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae.
.
By determining the crystal structure of one of the porins – OmpK36 ST258 (pictured) – the team made an exciting discovery: the existence of just two extra amino acids at a critical location caused a smaller pore size thus hindering movement of Carbepenem into the bacterium. These new findings help scientists understand the infection mechanisms of K. pneumoniae and supports the premise that more targeted use of antibiotics is needed in the treatment of infections. Read the full paper in Nature Communications (doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11756-y).

6,,,"What makes these beetles so white? Researchers studied two beetle species Lepidiota stigma (photo 1) and Cyphochilus (photo 2) and found out that the fantastic ultra-white beetle scales were the result of light scattering within the structure of the scales. With this knowledge it may be possible to design more sustainable paints. If paint can use the same trick as the beetle scales do white paints wouldn’t need to resort to pigments with a high carbon footprint.
.
The results were published in Communications Chemistry ( doi.org/10.1038/s42004-019-0202-8 ). You can find out more in a Behind  the Paper post by Stephanie Burg and Andrew Parnell on the Nature Research Chemistry Community: go.nature.com/2zoenpZ (link in bio).

.
Between 1799 and 1804 Humboldt travelled extensively across Latin America including two years in the Andes where he observed and documented everything he saw. His travel diary amounted to 4000 pages and his findings laid the foundation of contemporary natural sciences. Humboldt’s work continues to influence and inspire scientists across the globe today.
.
Contributing to our Humboldt Anniversary channel Dr Damien Esquerre (currently a post-doc in the Keogh Lab Australian National University and originally from Chile) describes some of his most recent work on the diversity of lizards around the Andes. Damien is also a wildlife photographer and took these amazing images! In order: the Chilean Andes; an egg-laying lizard; and a non-egg-laying lizard. Both these species live in the Andes but their exact location on the mountain determines their mode of reproduction (whether they lay eggs or not). 🦎🦎🦎

9,,,"3/3. Rotating neutron stars or pulsars are known to have occasional unpredictable “glitches” where the spin rate suddenly increases. In 2016 the Mount Pleasant radio telescope in Australia happened to catch a glitch in action in the Vela pulsar. Now researchers at Monash University in Melbourne have used this data to get a better idea of the pulse-to-pulse rotation changes that happen during a rotating neutron star glitch. Their finding matches a model in which the core of the pulsar is more complex than previously thought.

.
These fascinating marine animals are found all over the world. Some stony corals (scleractinia) are solitary but most live as colonies with their hard external skeletons forming the foundation of coral reef ecosystems.

13,,,"Mussels found a kilometre under the sea in the Gulf of Mexico are large in size and long in life making them ideal for studying the genetic diversity of symbiotic bacteria hosted in their gills. The mussels – Bathymodiolus brooksi – grow up to 24cm and may live 10 years or more. During their generous lifespan they are populated by several strains of bacteria filtered from the sea. Taking up residence within the cells of the mussel’s gill lining the bacteria synthesise chemicals that benefit their hosts.
.
On the Nature Research Microbiology Community Devani Romero Picazo (PhD candidate CAU University of Kiel) describes the surprising results she and colleagues observed when they studied the bacteria living in B.brooksi mussels sampled from a single location deep under the ocean: go.nature.com/2ZV4J9Y (link in bio). The researchers were looking to characterise the genetic diversity of the bacterial communities and unexpectedly they didn’t see genetic similarity between bacterial strains living in different mussels: each mussel had its own individualised symbiotic bacterial population.
.
About her cartoon Devani says: “Mussels here are represented as islands as they constitute patches of a habitat populated by several symbiont strains (represented by bacterial cells of different colours). Because there is little connectivity between mussels symbionts inhabiting the mussels develop into distinct subpopulations.”
.
Investigating how bacteria are dispersed on and among individual host organisms builds knowledge of bacterial ecology and evolution. .

In its current form the RoboBee X-wing has four wings driven by two piezoelectric actuators which convert electrical energy into mechanical movement. The energy is provided by a light-weight power source consisting of solar cells and a small electronics system - light enough to be carried by the RoboBee itself. Even though the vehicle only weighs 90 mg it can lift up to 370 mg which is enough for the miniature power source and leaves room to add sensors or additional electronics.

19,,,"Over the past 10 years a team of scientists from the University of Toronto have been working on ways to improve the analysis and visualisation of genomic data. They’ve also been baking!
.
Analysing genomic data often involves pathway enrichment analysis (finding connections between different sets genes) and the creation of an Enrichment Map and it’s this mapping or visualising part of the workflow that the authors have been developing. Their improved method and step-by-step guide to using it was published earlier this year in Nature Protocols (doi.org/10.1038/s41596-018-0103-9).

20,,,"Leonardo Chiappisi and colleagues from @tu_berlin have discovered a new way to prepare a coating film which they published recently in Communications Chemistry (doi.org/10.1038/s42004-019-0155-y). They used a complex sugar called chitosan extracted from the hard outer skeleton of shellfish! 🦞 .
This animation shows the process of how chitosan combined with fatty acids spontaneously forms multi-layered coating films. Coatings like this are used extensively from biomedicine to nanotechnology with a number of applications including: biomolecular sensing fire protection corrosion and fouling prevention. It’s usually a rather lengthy process to make them but Leonardo's approach to preparing coating films is innovative as it requires just a single step.

21,,,"The first humans to step foot on the moon did so exactly 50 years ago today. On July 20th 1969 the Apollo lunar module landed on the moon. Neil Armstrong emerged from the module first followed by Buzz Aldrin. The astronauts performed several operations on the surface of the moon for over 2 hours including collecting lunar samples and setting up experiments. One of the tasks that Armstrong and Aldrin carried out during their moonwalk was placing seismometers on the surface of the moon to record moonquakes the data from which is still being used today. .
A paper published earlier this year in Nature Geoscience (doi.org/10.1038/s41561-019-0362-2) connected Apollo seismic data to more recent images of the lunar landscape like this one showing young fault scarps (or cliff-like steps) on the surface of the moon suggesting that the moon is tectonically active and shrinking.

23,,,"According to a recent paper in Scientific Reports (doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39932-6) sun bears can precisely mimic the facial expressions of their playmate a social behaviour that has never been observed in non-primates before. The research was led by Dr Marina Davila-Ross from the University of Portsmouth.
.
Marina and her team travelled to the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre to study the facial complexity of 22 group-housed sun bears engaged in spontaneous social play (this video is an example of rough play).
.
The authors looked at whether or not the bears were able to precisely match a playmate’s open-mouthed facial expression. All the bears apart from one showed this behaviour and just over half did so within a second of observing a similar expression from a playmate when the bears were facing each other.
.
These findings suggest that facial communication is more widespread than previously thought and may not be exclusive to species with strong social tendencies (like humans).

25,,,"Scientists from Canada have discovered enzymes (in green and blue) in the human gut that can convert A type blood (+ yellow square) into O type (blue square only second image)! (the yellow/white square is the intermediate product).
.
O type blood (specifically O negative) is often referred to as the universal blood type because people of any blood type can receive it. A good supply of O type blood is therefore essential particularly during emergencies where a patient’s blood type is unknown or when supply is limited.
.
The research was published in Nature Microbiology (doi.org/10.1038/s41564-019-0469-7) and the authors hope that in the future these enzymes will be used to produce converted universal donor blood directly after blood donation providing blood banks more flexibility with their supply.

26,,,"Research published in Nature Ecology & Evolution (doi.org/10.1038/s41559-019-0903-5) shows that in response to an overhead drone the West African green monkey produces an alarm call which is distinct from those given to other predators but highly similar to the aerial alarm calls of the East African vervet monkey. Previous work has shown that the East African green monkey readily alarm calls to leopard and snake predator models but does not respond to an eagle predator model. Their intriguing response to a flying drone therefore suggests that alarm calls to aerial threats is an evolutionary conserved behaviour. The green monkeys also rapidly learnt what the sound of the drone meant – when it was played back to them through hidden speakers the monkeys scanned the sky and ran for cover! This video shows the response of a green monkey female to the playback of the drone sound.

28,,,"The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a forthcoming European space mission which aims to measure gravitational waves in a way not possible from Earth. Although not set for launch until 2034 scientists have calculated that LISA should be able to detect the existence of a theoretical particle called the ultralight boson.
.
This image is an artistic impression showing how the light boson would be detected. If light the particle does exists theory suggests that they form bosonic clouds (the white donut) around massive black holes (black spiral in the centre of the cloud donut). When a smaller black hole (the small black spiral at the edge of the donut) orbits the bigger black hole-bosonic-cloud system it emits gravitational waves. This signal provides a direct measurement of the ultralight boson which should be detectable by LISA (the red triangle partially shown). .
The calculations were published recently in Nature Astronomy (doi.org/10.1038/s41550-019-0712-4) and first author Otto Hannuksela a PhD student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong provides some background and context on the Nature Research Astronomy Community: go.nature.com/2NF2YbJ (link in bio).

The method is called ‘CellTagging’ and it works by labelling cells with genetic barcodes which are then inherited by their progeny. This image is a graphical representation of ‘CellTagging’. Each circle represents an individual cell and the connecting lines represent clonal relationships between cells. Cells that are clonally related share the same genetic barcodes or CellTag. Successive rounds of tagging create branching trees of related cells. The different colours indicate when the cells were tagged with lighter colours at the start and darker colours near the end. CellTagging could help scientists working regenerative medicine or cancer biology; they could use the technology to grow tissues or trace the history of cancerous cells for example.

In contrast almost all eukaryotes organise their genetic material into multiple chromosomes which vary in number from 8 in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and 32 in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to 46 chromosomes in humans. Professor Zhongjun Qin from the Chinese Academy of Sciences wondered if all the DNA from a eukaryote could be engineered into a single chromosome - and indeed it could! Their engineered yeast has 16 chromosomes fused into one. Perhaps surprisingly it grew fairly normally and could be a useful tool for industry.

84,,,"This is how to collect sediment samples from the bottom of the ocean! The ‘push corers’ are attached to a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and use a robotic arm to drive a tube into sediment to collect a column of mud about 20 cm deep. 
In 2014 Dr Leila Hamdan @hamdanlab @officialsouthernmiss and colleagues used this technique to collect samples from the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico. Here there are over 2000 historic shipwrecks and the team wanted to know how microbial communities living in around shipwrecked environments were impacted by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster. They visited seven historic shipwreck sites some at depths of 1500m collecting sediment samples which were then used to compare the biological chemical and physical conditions at different locations inside and outside the spill impact area. In this video samples are being collected near the Ewing Bank Shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Their findings were published recently in Scientific Reports (doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-27350-z). Click on our Stories Highlight ‘Shipwrecked’ to discover more.

104,,,"Following a lengthy selection process Dr Magdalena Skipper Editor-in-Chief of Nature Communications has been appointed as the new Editor-in-Chief of Nature. Dr Skipper will be only the eighth Editor-in-Chief in Nature’s 149-year history and the first to come from a life sciences background.  She will succeed Sir Philip Campbell who is moving to the newly created role of Editor- in-Chief of Springer Nature on 1 July 2018. 
Dr Skipper said “It is a tremendous honour and a privilege to have been entrusted with the leadership of Nature. It is especially exciting to be taking on this role at a time when the way science is done and disseminated is evolving. I look forward to continuing Nature’s leadership in publishing the most interesting and ground-breaking discoveries and providing a voice on important issues such as promoting transparency and diversity in science.” Dr Skipper received a PhD in genetics from the University of Cambridge and conducted research at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge after which she was a post-doctoral fellow at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) in London.  At Nature she was instrumental in the developing the innovative ENCODE Explorer and Epigenome Roadmap projects which pushed the boundaries of science publishing beyond the conventional research paper.  At Nature Communications she has been a strong champion of open research.

This is Julian Gutekunst postdoctoral researcher at the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Division of Epigenetics and first author of a recent Nature Ecology & Evolution paper (doi:10.1038/s41559-018-0467-9) reporting on the evolutionary genetics of the marbled crayfish. Julian is checking the high-performance computing infrastructure which enabled him and his colleagues to assemble the first version of the marbled crayfish’s complete genome processing 350 gigabase pairs of raw DNA to identify over 21000 genes.
The marbled crayfish is an unusual species having evolved very recently and forming all female populations and this work presents new information about its genomic structure evolutionary history and populations dynamics.

108,,,"This is a plasma reactor used to experimentally mimic the chemical composition of Titan’s atmosphere. Titan is Saturn’s largest moon and the only moon in the solar system to host a dense atmosphere. Titan’s atmosphere is mainly composed of molecular nitrogen and methane; when exposed to solar UV radiation these molecules produce a multitude of aerosols responsible for the brownish haze surrounding Titan. Using the plasma reactor as a basis for laboratory experiments Professor Nathalie Carrasco @uvsq_universite and colleagues have been able to reveal how the chemical and optical properties of Titan’s haze evolve as it descends through the atmosphere. The work was published recently in Nature Astronomy (doi:10.1038/s41550-018-0439-7) and you can read Nathalie’s story behind the paper on the Nature Research Astronomy Community: go.nature.com/2qjbUZG. If you’re wondering what the pink light in the middle of the reactor is it’s a nitrogen aurora which is emitted due to the excitation of nitrogen molecules as they collide with electrons during experiments inside the reactor.

Agriculture logging and urban growth have caused unprecedented losses of tropical forest in the past few decades. In a recent Nature paper (doi:10.1038/nature25508) Franziska Taubert and colleagues examined the patterns of tropical forest fragmentation using high-resolution satellite data identifying 130 million forest fragments across three continents that showed remarkable similarities in their size frequency distributions. The authors adapted a method from physics to mathematically describe this pattern and explain how this allows to model and understand tropical forest fragmentation on a global scale.

However the white canary has a mutation which prevents it from absorbing carotenoid pigments and so it grows white feathers not yellow. To test hypotheses about the biological benefits of carotenoids Rebecca Koch Adrian postdoctoral researcher @monash_uni and colleagues from @auburnu compared the performance of yellow and white canaries on a series of physiological challenges.

The tail more than twice the size of its body (so long we needed two images!) is characteristic of early spider relatives whereas the presence of silk-spinning organs is typical of more advanced modern spiders. It’s thought that these fossils provide the link between ancient arachnids and primitive living spiders. The specimens are described in two papers published this week in Nature Ecology & Evolution which provide new insights into the evolution of spiders.

Tobias Warnecke and his lab at @imperialcollege sequenced haemoglobin from 15 different deer species to look at the genetic difference between sickling and non-sickling deer. They found that a single mutation causes the sickle shape just as in humans although through a different mechanism. The sickling mutation in deer happened far in the past around 13 million years ago and arctic deer such as reindeer were all non-sickling together suggesting that it may offer some protection against parasitic disease which isn’t present in cold regions. The research was published in Nature Ecology & Evolution.

135,,,Disgust is a powerful trait. It protects animals from eating dangerous or unpleasant food such as poisonous insects. But how do predators recognise unprofitable prey and can they learn disgust by watching others? Rose Thorogood Hanna Kokko and Johanna Mappes from @cambridgeuniversity @universityofhelsinki @unizh and @uniofJyvaskyla showed great tits a video shown above of another great tit eating a foul tasting nut. The tit wipes its beak and shakes its head to show disgust. Birds who watched this video were more likely to avoid food packages with the square mark on as shown in the second part of the video above. This research published in Nature Ecology & Evolution shows for the first time that disgust can evolve when birds watch each other at least in laboratory conditions.

Using comparative genomics the O'Malley Lab @ucsantabarbara have provided – for the first time – a comprehensive set of proteins critical to fungal cellulosome assembly. Their findings also suggest that the fungal cellulosome is an evolutionarily chimeric structure – an independently evolved fungal complex that co-opted useful activities from bacterial.

Nicole Dubilier's Symbiosis Department at Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen Germany studies these fascinating symbioses. The robotic submersible MARUM-Quest remotely operated by its pilot carefully collects samples bubbling from the oil-soaked sediments. Research in Nature Microbiology described a new association between deep sea mussels and sponges and Cycloclasticus bacteria that unusually use short-chain alkanes such as propane ethane and butane as their carbon and energy sources.
