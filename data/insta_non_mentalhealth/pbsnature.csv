These color changes while sleeping may suggest they do.

Cephalopods activate their color-changing cells in response to changes in their environment.

This dark shift in color mimics the change that happens when octopuses leave the seafloor.

Although research into cephalopod sleep and dreaming has grown
there isn't enough evidence to say for sure if they dream the way people do.]|Incredible.|I mean it looks like dreaming to me. 😳|Wonderful!!!|They are miraculous!!! 🐙💙💙💙|I love octopus 🐙|@shellcastle|They dream of unpolluted oceans.|So so amazing...|What do octopuses dream of?

Cephalopods have thousands of color-changing cells called chromatophores each containing an elastic sac full of pigment.

Their complex system of nerves and muscles contracts or expands these sacs resulting in instant color changes.

Combined with their ability to change the texture of their skin octopuses are masters of camouflage - blending perfectly into their surroundings when needed.]|@matt_doc_dougherty|Can’t wait to watch!!!|😍😍😍😍😍😍|I can’t wait for this ‼️|Woah cool.|Amazing!

160,,,Elephants are known to form deep family bonds with one another and elephant families have an older matriarchal head leading the herd. Here two female stand side by side at Abu Camp home of Naledi and five other female elephants. They are part of a free-roaming herd which means they can choose to move off with wild elephants if hey choose to do so one day. #ProductionTakeover,productiontakeover,|Fantastic creatures!,350
161,,,Born on an incredibly starry night Naledi (which means ‘star’ in Setswana) was orphaned just six weeks later when her mother passed away. Other members of the herd stepped in to help care for Naledi providing milk and teaching Naledi how to be an elephant. #ProductionTakeover,productiontakeover,|Such amazing animals. We humans could learn some lessons from these magnificent mammals !|😞👍🏽|@gloria.roa1,551
162,,,The Abu herd consists of six female elephants with Kathie as the matriarch in her mid-50s. As part of the free-roaming herd the elephants can choose to move off with wild elephants but they still enjoy coming into an enclosure at night where they are protected and have supplemental food and water. The herd has a veterinarian on call in Maun a half hour flight to Abu should the need arise. #ProductionTakeover,productiontakeover,|Fantastic Creatures|This is great,275
163,,,Getting a baby elephant to go to sleep can be difficult. Here’s a parenting tip from Naledi’s caretakers: provide lots of food and snuggles. #productiontakeover,productiontakeover,|Can't wait for everyone to fall in love with Naledi tonight!|We love Naledi!
