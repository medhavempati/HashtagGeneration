4,,,"Tenants in Delhi often complained about their inability to avail the benefits of the power subsidies provided by the Delhi Government. 
After much research into the technicalities, we came up with a smart solution i.e providing pre - paid meters to tenants. 
Pre - Paid meters would function on the same principle as a pre-paid mobile recharge. 
This scheme would benefit all tenants residing in Delhi.

9,,,"The CBSE recently announced hike in board exam fees across categories. The fee for SC/ST students under the CBSE increased from Rs. 50 to Rs 1,200, that of General Category students was up from Rs 750, to Rs 1,500. 
The exorbitant fees pressed the pockets of many families for whom education is no less than a luxury. 
In this light, we decided to offload the financial burden of our students and parents. 
The Delhi Government will now pay examination fee of 3.14 Lakh students. 
We believe that every child should have equality of opportunity in education.

14,,,"Politicians avail benefits like FREE electricity STARTING FROM 50,000 units per year which is provided to them from the tax payers hard earned money. 
Today, Arvind Kejriwal provides subsized electricity UPTO 200 units to the the tax payers from their own money. 
Why is it that when the common man benefits - BJP has a problem?

Why is it that when AAP Government can provide 24hours electricity at the lowest rates possible - BJP run state Governments fail to do the same? •

18,,,"Vijay's family struggled family as his father is a tailor and mother worked as domestic help. Availing private coaching for engineering was a far- fetched dream. 
In class 12th Vijay signed up as a beneficiary of ‘Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana’, which provided free coaching to students hailing from weak socio - economic backgrounds and helping them meet their academic goals.

It was this scheme which gave Vijay wings to fly as he was offered admission in the renowned IIT, Delhi. 
Reading about this grand success story, Varun Gandhi - a Delhi based businessman came forward to support vijay. The family will be funding Vijay's education at IIT Delhi. 
Instead of donating money to a temple, making a talented kid realise his dream of IIT is a much bigger service to God,"" - @arvindkejriwal . •

35 underprivileged students, who got free coaching under the scheme, cracked the JEE Main and NEET examination this year.

5 of them secured admissions to leading technical and medical institutions such as Lady Hardinge College, IIT-Delhi, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, National Institute of Technology Delhi and Banaras Hindu University. •

It has generally been seen that when piped water is made easily available then people don't take interest in water conservation.. This is so because their dependency on ground water ends. This impedes water conservation efforts.  While some areas do need piped water but I would rather suggest that your government start an awareness program on rain water harvesting. Only then can we ensure that the water issue in Delhi gets permanently resolved.  People need to be incentivised to built rain water harvesting structures.. Only when local community gets involved, can the problem be resolved.  Traditional water holding structures like baoli, wells, kund need to be refurbished.|Amazing work done by @arvindkejriwal .

31,,,"@arvindkejriwal's Govt Making India Proud Across the World🇮🇳 Former CEO of Apple and Pepsi John Sculley and his wife Diane Sculley, during their visit to India, visited a mohalla clinic in the capital’s Kamala Nagar Monday. “The former CEO wanted to visit a mohalla clinic after reading about it in the foreign media. The party’s volunteer in the US helped them fix the visit… They asked a couple of questions over the functioning of these health centres,” said a senior health official.

According to officials, the duo compared the Universal Health Programme in their country with the health setup in India. “Visiting an urgent care clinic in Delhi, India. Health should not be about taking drugs to get well but taking care of yourself – exercise, eat right, have good friends and partners,” they tweeted after the visit.

This is not the first time that the AAP government’s ambitious healthcare project has been praised internationally.

Last year, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon visited a mohalla clinic and a polyclinic and praised the primary healthcare services provided to the city’s poor. .

39,,,"Remembering the missile man of India; our former President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam. 
Back in 2015, we were honored to have him as our Chief guest addressing the teachers of Delhi Government Schools. 
It was a moment of great pride for us that he recognized our contribution and transformation that we sought to bring about in the field of healthcare and education for ALL

Time and again his vision has been our guiding light to build the India of his dreams. 
We believe, that the legacy of Dr. Kalam can only be taken further, when we are inspired by it to a point that we make it OUR MISSION.

40,,,"Threat to transparency & threat to democracy. 
The 2019 amendment bill seeks to modify these protections and empower the central government to prescribe rules to decide the tenure, salaries and allowances of these commissioners. 
State information commissioners are appointed by the Governor based on the recommendation of the Chief Minister, Leader of Opposition of the Legislative Assembly and a state Cabinet Minister. They can be removed or suspended only by the Governor. State governments are empowered to prescribe the salaries and allowances and the terms and conditions of service of the officers and employees. 
Allowing the central government to do so for all information commissioners is harmful for the following reasons: it undermines the autonomy of the officials whose role it is to remain independent of the government; it weakens the ability of information commissioners to pass orders to disclose information that the central government may not wish to provide; and it also damages citizens’ access to vital public information, as well as the principles of open government.

By allowing the central government to take the power to decide their salaries and tenures, the proposed amendments undermine the authority of state governments and the spirit of federalism, and further concentrates powers with the central government. .

*“अब और कितने आश्वासन?”*
उत्तर पूर्वी दिल्ली के सीलमपुर विधानसभा इलाके में लगभग 3 दशकों से लाइब्रेरी की मांग चलती आ रही है केंद्र सरकार हो या राज्य सरकार इन्होंने हर मौके पर शिक्षा के मुद्दे को भुनाया है मगर आज तक इस क्षेत्र के नेताओं ने लोगों की इस मांग को आगे तक नही पहुँचाया है। कई बार क्षेत्रीय नेताओ ने इलाके के लोगों को आश्वासन दिया परन्तु इसका परिणाम शून्य ही प्राप्त हुआ। सन 1993 में पहली बार क्षेत्र में चौ. मतीन अहमद जनता दल के टिकट से विधायक बन कर आए थे उस समय क्षेत्र के छात्रों ने अपनी पढाई को बेहतर ढंग से करने के लिए क्षेत्रीय विधायक के सामने लाइब्रेरी का प्रस्ताव रखा था जिसका आज तक कोई समाधान नही किया गया और जिन छात्रों ने इस मुद्दे पर आवाज़ उठाई थी आज वे लोग खुद विभिन्न क्षेत्रों में कार्यरत हैं। उनमें से कुछ छात्र आज दिल्ली के अलग अलग स्कूलों में अध्यापक की भूमिका निभा रहे हैं।
अबकी बार फिर से नवंबर 2018 के आरम्भ में कुछ छात्रों ने मिल कर क्षेत्र में लाइब्रेरी बनाने का प्रस्ताव क्षेत्रीय विधायक हाजी इशराक खान के सामने रखा जिसके बदले में उन्होंने ये आश्वासन दिया की लाइब्रेरी तो एक बहुत ही छोटा सा मुद्दा है इसे तो हम 2 दिन में ही बना सकते हैं मगर अब इस बात को 10 महीने हो चुके हैं परंतु अभी तक छात्रों को सिवाए आश्वासन के कुछ भी नही मिला है। दरअसल जाफराबाद-मौजपुर एक घनी आबादी वाला क्षेत्र है और इस क्षेत्र में कारख़ाने बहुतायत मात्रा में मौजूद हैं और यहाँ घरों के आकार बहुत छोटे हैं जिस कारण छात्रों को पढ़ने के लिए जगह की बहुत कमी रहती है इन परेशानियों के चलते इन छात्रों ने मिलकर इलाके में एक लाइब्रेरी की मांग की थी जिसके बदले छात्रों को केवल आश्वासन और झूठे बहाने ही प्राप्त हुए हैं। क्षेत्रीय विधायक हाजी इशराक खान और निगम पार्षदों(अब्दुल रहमान,रेशमा नदीम) द्वारा छात्रों की मांग को शिक्षा मंत्री या मुख्यमंत्री तक पहुंचने की बजाए हमेशा ही जगह की कमी का बहाना लेकर टाल दिया गया है जबकि इस क्षेत्र में पुलिस स्टेशन, पोस्ट ऑफिस, मुहल्ला क्लिनिक इत्यादि सभी किराए की जगहों पर चल रहे हैं तो सवाल ये है कि इसी प्रकार से लाइब्रेरी क्यों स्थापित नही की जा सकती?|*“तीन दशकों से चल रही है जाफराबाद में लाइब्रेरी की मांग पर आज भी हैं वंचित यहाँ के छात्र”*

नजफगढ़ में साईं बाबा मंदिर के पास स्थित कॉलोनी में बुधवार को तोड़फोड़ की कार्रवाई हुई। विरोध की संभावनाओं के बीच यहां काफी पुलिस बल तैनात की गई थी। ... विस, नजफगढ़ : नजफगढ़ में साईं बाबा मंदिर के पास स्थित कॉलोनी में बुधवार को तोड़फोड़ की कार्रवाई हुई। विरोध की संभावनाओं के बीच यहां काफी पुलिस बल तैनात की गई थी। लोगों का आरोप है कि यह पूरी कार्रवाई गैरकानूनी तरीके से की जा रही है। कॉलोनियों के लोगों के अनुसार, उन्हें किसी तरह का नोटिस भी नहीं दिया गया है। जबकि अचानक आकर उन्हें घर खाली करने के लिए काफी कम समय दिया जा रहा है।
गौरतलब है कि उक्त जगह से द्वारका-गुड़गांव एक्सप्रेसवे निकल रहा है। यह सड़क काफी सालों पहले पास हुई थी। इससे पहले भी इस सड़क के चलते 24 घरों को तोड़ा गया था। लोगों के अनुसार, अब एक फैक्ट्री को बचाने के लिए कॉलोनी के घरों को तोड़ा जा रहा है। लोगों के अनुसार, बिना किसी मुआवजे के उन्हें हटाया जा रहा है। जबकि सड़क के नक्शे के अनुसार, उक्त कॉलोनी में 24 घरों और एक फैक्ट्री को तोड़ना था, लेकिन अब फैक्ट्री की बजाय कॉलोनी का ही सफाया किया जा रहा है। यह पूरी कार्रवाई डीडीए ने की है। ऐसे में लोगों में डीडीए को लेकर भी नाराजगी है।|Good work|Fake parche kaha gye handsome sisodilal?|What @aamaadmiparty promised, they did it. 👏👏🙏 So much respect for you @arvindkejriwal Sir and @msisodia.aap Sir|Nice",3894

47,,,"Arvind Kejriwal Government Takes A Historic Step In The Field Of Education ⏩A total of Rs.14.17 crores were released for scholarships of more than 2400 students, under ‘Scholarship For Higher Education Program’. ⏩This is the first time in India that scholarships are being distributed on the basis of the economic background of a student instead of any other factors including caste. ⏩The purpose behind Aam Aadmi Party’s ‘Scholarship For Higher Edu Program’ is that no student of Delhi leaves his study, due to lack of money.

Now in Delhi we have made such arrangements that any child born in Delhi will not be deprived of good studies because of lack of money. I assure every parent of Delhi – “I am responsible for the education of your child, you do not worry about money at all.” @arvindkejriwal .

I think you didn't get my point that's why such weired comment. He could have shown the ambulance, doctor's team that is ready to go or an image of the para medical support that he is willing to provide as help, instead of their smiling faces over the tragic incident. I am from Bihar and to me Bihar is sufficient enough to handle this on their own with getting into his political motive, what has happened is really bad but it's not an epidemic like situation. Support will definitely help. He should focus on work rather than displaying that he has plan to work.|Why waiting.. उनको मदद की बहुत सख्त जरूरत है.. जल्द से जल्द मदद पहूंचाईऐ.. Don't mind about negative comments|@priya_akc hope you got my point and I don't want to debate on a word. I have stayed in Ahmedabad for nearly a decade and now for 5years in Delhi NCR and known how Modi has functioned there and now in Delhi. I am not a bhakt but I see him atleast working and this fellow is rejecting everything for Delhi public like #ayushmanbharat and then criticising that it didn't work. He will not coming again to power for sure, what he has done is not well planned or thought. In India every government project is done twice, once to know if it will work and then they actually do what has to work. If they don't come to power again then what actually has to be implemented is never again. Transition from no blackboard to getting Swimming pool, playground and solar energy is good but I highly doubt they are going to maintain it even for a year or two. The basic infrastructure is yet not visible. What's worst is that he has no ideology or principle is life he joined hand with Lalu to defeat Modi. He should maintain some standard on what he post and how he post thing. He has record of being welcomed by shoes, slaps,, sandles, ink etc. He is a drama queen and know nothing about his work  other than doing dharna. I actually wasting time writing about him. ......Glad that you took out time to visit my profile and thanks appreciating, I am still learning and trying to be better.

For ex: Whenever a woman started travelling alone or travelling in odd times ask them to switch on the app. Once they reach their destination safely they will switch off the app. Once the app is switched on, it’s should be tracked untill the app stopped by women. If women forgot to switch off the app, her safety should be confirm by call from a woman safety team(it may be a exclusive call centre for women safety).|My suggestion don't do it use that money to help to infrastructure|Make metro and bus free to all citizen of lower income group despite there gender.|The same should be practiced for the student..|Bus free krdo only .. metro.. ka lafda mat baalo....|Have you gone through the pros and cons of your scheme.|❤️|We don't want free metro rides.... lower the price for both man and women.|Good job|@arvindkejriwal  Sir ji apse bdya insan koe nhi  jis hisab se ap delhi ke lia kam kr rha ho ana vala tym me delhi bhot aga ja chuki hogi aur states se aur rhi baat @aamaadmiparty  ek ase party hai joh kbhi dhekava nhi karti mehnat pe bhrosa krti hai kam krne pe bhrosa krti hai aur jeetna vikas delhi me kejriwal sir ji ne kia hai syd es india ke ander koe nhi kr skta aj hamari delhi me hr galiya paki bn chuki hein jadatar aur ,sever pipe line ka be lag bhag kam khatam hone ko hai, road bda ho rha hai, metro ke line ab hr ek chota kona me jane ko hai , aur water , electricity , education ,  health  facilities  yeah to phle se he bdya kr chuka th pr ab us kam ko aur bdya kr rhi hai hamari aam admi party yeh party shi maina me ek party hai joh desh ke vikas ke lia ayi hai naki modi ji ke trah baatain bna ke logo ke mn me jhga banati hai faltu ke drama krkar yeh party imandar insan ke hai aur joh log kejriwal sir ji pr arope lagata hakna lgao jhuta arope bhagwan hamesa yehi kehta hai jeet hamesa imandari ke hoti hai sachai ke hoti agar burai ke kithni be kiu nh ser chad jya pr ek imandar insan joh duniya ke lia lad rha hota hai usko to galiya hamesa phdti hai voh hai hamara @arvindkejriwal  sir aur rhi baat modi ji ke unka kam sirf fekna hai voh modi bhakt jb to nhi bola kch be jb election  ke bich 14 army ke javan saheed hua th voh to syd kisi modi bhakt ko yd nhi hai aur media hamare puri beki hue hai usne be kch ghante tk dhikaya uske bd exit poll  wah mera desh ke pm trse mahan aur tera andha bhakt sbko rula kr jayaga joh modi jaisa insan desh ke sanik ka nhi hua voh desh ka kya hoga meto yeh bolunga sara bhaiyo tume har ghr me kejriwal sir jaisa insan hona chaiya naki baatain bnane vala modi hona chaiya aur nahi desh ke ander ek khatarnak gunda hona chaiya amit saha international  done yeh desh chalaynge khud drugs ka dhanda krwane vala crime krwane vala rape krwane vala chrdo bolne ko to bhot kch hai pr kiu apna muh ganda krna ganda logo ke bimari khol ke 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 jai hind ! jai bharat !

I am not against any development or people or politician or political parties neither in favour. Just need a logical answer to understand why is it necessary to give free rides to women only. I think labours require the most for this facility if its going to happen. What's the logic ?

Schools.|Agree with you|No plz reduce fare instead free to women and try to generate income|Sir I support you.. but this is not good decision..

But old men and women are mostly not employed so they should be given free service. Your party is now taking actions like BJP. Please don't spoil your better image in front of us.|Great step|😍😍😍|1. As regards to how to implement metro free travel for women first important part is to identify real deprived and economical weaker section in women , infact I would suggest distribution of access cards/travel cards to them door step, this will not only boost the confidence in them also will bring them closer to participation with #aap. 
2. All the users of access cards be registered and for the every month free ride , they should voluntarily agree to serve couple of hours on any day of the month at desired metro stations to supervise fair use of these cards, and add up to women safety.
3. Voluntarily special fund should be raised for women safety, just fully loading the expense on delhi tax payers may not be appropriate. Awareness to be made in people the fund will be utilised exclusively for their own family women, to help cctv surveillance. Close network ,women rescue teams should be available close to stations ,pick and drop points.
 More than Metro and DtC buses the safety is primarily important after end point of metro stations or buses drop point to their local residence , primarily night times. Apart from cctv many places street lights also concern, empty places barren lands need to be identified and special lightening cc tv should be provided in such areas, 
4. Most importantly women safety wing should work in close coordination with legal team, to prosecute culprits of such crime, irrespective of age, caste creed to set confidence in women.|Pata nahi 🤔.

Don't run a blind race.If you want to form your government again then please do something worthy as we are not dumb so you can buy our votes after providing free services.We want to know from where this much revenue will come ??

I think they are useless for you just like you are for us.|😂😂😂😂|#BJPAaeyegiDelhiMuskuraygi|#DelhiMeinBhiBhajpaSarkar|#KejriwalHataoDelhiBachao|😍😍😍|aap is no more different than any other political parties. Implementing scheme just to lure voters, nothing else. You've posted video of poor women, great! But will you post video of poor men as well who is frustrated? Remember, poverty don't discriminate based on gender. You talk about education then make metro fare free for students (or atleast reduce the price, because in India girls are generally not allowed to have education because of expenditure and society's sick mentality). This way you will uplift the students and hence improving the education system. FYI, it has already been implemented by some of the European countries like Germany. 2nd thing - make it free for poor and disabled people irrespective of gender. poor/disable mens are also *aam Aadmi*. ( But I think for disabled people, fares are discounted) Just think about Mr. Kejriwal's daughter traveling in metro for free but a struggling poor men is not allowed to travel for free. Did AAP even though about it? One more thing, considering best case 50:50 male:female ratio in Delhi, DTC/metro prices will almost be doubled for all men INCLUDING POOR MEN. Now, assuming Delhi government won't increase the metro prices, how it gonna compensate loss in metro operation ? By increasing prices of something else or by asking more budget from centre for Delhi from government or maybe raiding the corrupt politicians. I as a *aam aadmi* I don't support this scheme and strongly object. This has very low impact on women empowerment and safety. I hope AAP supporter will understand this.|Great job sir👍👍👍👍|@arvindkejriwal AK jesa koi nhi|AAP is the BEST.|AAP Zindabad|❤️|Are bhen*hod Bahut zyada discrimination hai ....madarjjaat Pahle education system mein itna discrimination fir aab Public transport mein reserved seats kam thi???

Here are some answers to questions many of you may have:
1. How will free travel make travel safe?
As of now only 33% of Metro commuters are women. The fare hike last year hit women the worst forcing them to shift to more unsafe modes of transport like private buses, ride sharing, or even walking. This move will help them return to the Metro's safety. More women in any public spaces automatically makes those spaces safer for women. This move will help women reclaim public spaces. 
2. Will this affect the financial viability of Delhi Metro?
No, the ticket revenue lost by Delhi Metro will be reimbursed fully by the Delhi government. DMRC will not suffer at all because of this. 
3. Won't this result in overcrowding in the Metro?
No. When Phase 3 was planned, the estimated capacity was 40 lakhs ridership daily. But at the moment only 25 lakh commuters are using it, which is 15 lakh less than capacity. 
4. Why don't men need a subsidy on Metro travel?
Men may also need financial assistance, however, men have other alternatives that dont compromise their safety. For example, men have the option of taking two wheelers to work or using ride sharing apps without concern for their safety.|I don't criticize KEJRIWAL, but some decisions like allowing rift with Kumar Vishwas.

Women don’t travel via public because they don’t have money. It’s because they don’t feel safe. Still, no big deal. Everybody does something to come in limelight before elections.|Bad for delhi",3993

Why do you think that free fares for women would ensure security , i travel by dtc buses on a regular basis and i don't believe that dtc buses are safe because we face harassment in moving buses and no one not even the driver or the conductor utter a single word against it . If your main concern is security of women thn instead of doing this pls either increase the no. Of women coaches in metro or start the new bus services specifically for women with the normal fares of any other dtc bus and with that employ only women as the drivers of those buses in such a way you can even ensure security of women and can also give employment to them . Doing this is nothing but useless as there are many more needy people who can have the advantage of this thing but just bcz they donot fall into this category they will not get this. This is such a useless proposal. Please think about it again!|Can any gender biased decision encourage development? I don't think so. And Why are we even discussing equality then? It will be much better if this decision was based on economic grounds.|Because all the buses were filled with AAP supporters|🙏🙏|It's a bad idea better reduce fare for all. If anyone can't pay for bus fare also than she isn't earning or a beggar which conductor most of the time don't charge and let them travel for free. Reduce the metro fare for both even we spend thousands in travel in Ⓜ Metro, without earning a dime cause we are students. I welcomed the Bus Pass decision because it was going to help everyone despite the gender. Do something like that and earn our respect and vote, or get ready to loose. This trump card won't work this election season.|As per my opinion , it won't be free. It will give extra burden to government as well as it will increase rush in both bus & metro. Who can buy token, won't do it|Reduce fare for all that will work and everyone will be happy|aadmiyo se kya dushmani h free nai kiraya kam hi karwa do|Good idea, good job|SIR I UNDERSTAND THE CONDITION OF WOMEN IN OUR COUNTRY BUT MAKING IT FREE FOR WOMEN TO TRAVEL IN BUSES AND METRO WILL BE KIND OF DISCRIMINATION. IT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA BUT IT INCREASES A SENSE OF FEMINISM IN OUR SOCIETY.SO I REQUEST YOU TO NOT MAKE TRAVEL FREE FOR WOMEN BUT TO REDUCE THE PRICE UP TO 50% FOR WOMEN IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO USE PUBLIC TRANSPORT.🔥|That's what equality is..hehe..good swing @arvindkejriwal|I just want to say free m sb de do fr bhi log kahenge aur de do self dependent bnaye logo ko na ki kisi aur pe depend u will ruin delhi and india|Very bad decision...|Deputy cm ho to Sisodia sir jaise 👍|@aamaadmiparty If you are really thinking about women safety then you guys should increase the number of buses on route instead of making fare free.|Good job|Though I have supported most of the moves taken by you in the right direction but I do not support this inequality.

EVM VIRODHI RASHTRIYA JAN ANDOLAN
NATIONAL CALL TO PROTEST AGAINST EVMs ON 30TH MAY 2019!
SAY NO TO EVM SARKAR!
WE DEMAND THAT ELECTIONS BE HELD ONLY BY BALLOT PAPER!
MASS DEMONSTRATION IN MUMBAI AT CSTM SUBWAY NO. 1, NEAR AZAD MAIDAN, AT 5.00PM ON THURSDAY, 30TH MAY 2019
Dear Friends,
The outcome of the recent Parliamentary elections has shocked the entire nation. We always believed that EVMs are hacked on a massive scale by the BJP and our belief is strongly substantiated by numbers now. The website of the Election Commission (EC) shows that the ""votes counted"" do not match with ""votes polled"", in all the 48 constituencies in Maharashtra. It did not match in 203 assembly constituencies of Madhya Pradesh also. This is enough to prove that EVMs were manipulated and it is therefore very clear that the results cannot be believed in. 
Many people from across the country are posting on social media, on the discrepancies in the votes in their constituencies. We have all witnessed the malfunctioning of EVMs and looked on bewildered at the suspicious movements of thousands of EVMs, which were even found in hotel rooms.
Right from the first phase of polling, almost the entire media was reporting that the NDA is going to suffer a minimum loss of 140 seats. More than 50% population that is dependent on agriculture was extremely disappointed and angry with the Modi Govt due to the worsening agrarian crisis and rising rate of suicides. The issues of Demonetization which itself was the biggest organised scam ever, the extremely anarchic implementation of the GST, rising unemployment, the Rafale scam among many other issues, were supposed to be the key issues against the government. Where did it all the anger and discontent disappear??
Moreover why is there a complete ""Sannata"", a ""Silence"" across the country, even after Modi returned to power by securing over 45% votes for the NDA??? Why aren't the citizens jubiliant?? This shows that the people are stunned and in a state of utter disbelief. They too did not expect a victory for BJP - and that is why we call it the ""EVM Sarkar"".
We have all seen the biased approach of the Elec|Good job sir|It's so sad Delhi people has not value education system which upgraded their childrens|Keep ur egos aside... Unite all ex party members... Kejriwal has ruined image of aap party and its moto... Anti modi anti modi rant is not working at all instead it was biggest backfire.. So plz stop that...

75,,,"What comes to your mind when you think of a government school? 
Dingy classrooms, no benches, and an overall poor infrastructure? (As shown in picture 1)

Well, Swipe Left and look at the government schools in Delhi. They are enough to bust these stereotypes. 
The day every government school becomes like this where every child regardless of his caste/religion/economic background can study together that day, there will be no more need for #Reservations.

Dear Delhi,
Vote for education. 
Vote for development. 
Vote for honest leaders. 
Make sure you go out to vote. And elect the best candidates. Don't get swayed by names and brands. Check who is the best candidate for your constituency and vote for them. Remember you get to elect your MP and not PM! 
#Vote4AAP

The government schools have made an unprecedented performance by registering 94.25 passing percentage of class XII students. This is the first time in last 20 years that the passing percentage of government school students have crossed the benchmark of 90 percent. On the other hand all private schools of Delhi have been remained dismal and reduced at 82.59 pass percentage. I don't think such remarkable achievement has ever made by any other state government in India. Despite all negativity and vicious propaganda by the mainstream media against Delhi Government and Arvind Kejriwal, the AAP Government has been remained focused on Education, Transport, Governance and Health sector. Overall AAP performance in Delhi highly satisfied. The CBSE results of class 12th just a testimony of how Delhi Government working on Education sector and finally Delhi Schools have excelled over private schools. Many congratulations to all students who have passed the Class 12th CBSE Board exams.|❤️🙌|👍👍👍|👌👌👍|अलका लांबा जी आप पार्टी की जान हैं उन्हें पार्टी से अलग ना करें केजरीवाल sir ! सच के लिए लड़ने वाली लेडी|Namo again|Only Modiji This Time......🚩|कृप्या मेरी लिखी हुई कुछ पोस्ट देखिए, आपको ज़रूर पसंद आएंगी। सभी बड़ी महनत और दिल से लिखी हैं ☺️☺️|https://strawpoll.com/3wf4ps5a|We want you again in delhi.|👍👍👍|Best wishes aatishi ji aapko|Chatu|Delhi se aap  hi jitenge.

चढ़ती दीवारों पर, सौ बार फिसलती है

कोशिश करने वालों की हार नहीं होती ।। ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️|This is the thing only which don't allow u to win your propaganda is not to develop the Delhi your ultimate goal is too defeat bjp....🙄🙄🙄|best of luck sir|ताकि भविष्य में ""आप"" भाजपा (BJP) से गठबंधन के विकल्प ढूँढे। 2015 में कांग्रेस का विकल्प ढूँढने वाला बौना आज कांग्रेस के साथ गठबंधन कर उसी की गोद में बैठने को लालायित है।|Mtlb inhe jeetne ki ichha hai hi nahi bas bjp ko harana hai😂😂😂 sapne to achhe dekho|East or west modi Jee is the best ❤️❤️👍👍👍🇮🇳 Bharat mata ki jai|👍|Sir*|modi modi|Kharcha kya tera tau dega|Don't say like this...say...Jitna hai Delhi me karne ke liye kam na ki BJP ko harane ke liye...

माना जाता है कि समाज में कुछ व्यक्ति अधिक विद्या,बुद्धि, योग्यता और साधन सम्पन्न होते हैं जबकि अधिकांश व्यक्ति अपेक्षाकृत अल्पमात्रा में ही इनके स्वामी होते हैं। किसी भी राजव्यवस्था में सभी  व्यक्तियों के समान महत्व की बात केवल शब्दों में ही हो सकती है, वस्तुतः नहीं।
लोकतंत्र में भी राजव्यवस्था पर वास्तविक रूप में नियंत्रण इस अल्पसंख्यक उच्चवर्ग का ही होता है और यही अभिजन है।|Koi nhi aane wala|Very nice  call|Bilkul sir m caminggg to Delhi|I suppose you sir kindly pick up your candidates in other states also we don't have any option between both these lazy parties 😞😞|Bolye sir aana h or bolna h|Delhi ka good luck h..ki unka C.M ak iiten mechanical engineer k saat saat IRS (ias) officer h💝👍👍.....khas hmara P.M bi graduate hota😏😏|Always ready|Sir EVM KO HATA DO apko kahne ki jaroorat hi nahi padega ...aap Jeet hi rahe ho...Kam dekhta h Sir|We need AAP ❤️ We need peace 🙏 We need @arvindkejriwal as our leader 😊|OK|Apna vote miss hai is baar.... 😔😔|rahenge kaha par waha aake|@arvindkejriwal kuch intajam kiye hein kya rehne ka hum ayenge|Right 👍👍|Land lelo|भाई प्रदान मंन्त्री तो मोदी को बनाना है ।।।।सोरी|Only  arvind kejriwal|are saddd ji..... aapko to kisi ne bhaw hi ni dia....😂😂😂😂..... congress , Maya ,mamta... sbko pta h aap dubti nayya pe sawar ho... saddd ji.... akal ka andha hi vote dega khujliwal n chor party ko.... 😂😂|Kaise aaye??|Jai ho...

We are a party comprised of driven, empathetic and passionate individuals from all walks of life. We aren't career politicians born into powerful families or bolstered by a hardline cult or driven by big corporations. When we first took office in the nation's capital, our ideas were questioned as too idealistic and unsustainable.

AAP proved them all wrong. We showed that with the right intent, public money can simultaneously empower the least privileged, while booming the economy to the pink of health for everyone.

Our movement must take another leap now. It's time the residents of Delhi have an accountable law & order system. It's time the people get to decide on many details like how to use their land, how to price the metro, or whom to hire for projects among various others.

This transformation begins with full statehood. Support AAP to establish real democracy in the capital.

Hum bhartiya sabko English hi kyon sikhni hai. Are kya jaroori hai ? Kaunse angrezz ne Hindi ya Marathi sikhli ? Hum kyu bole Angrezi? India ke pass Tamil Telugu Marathi Hindi Sanskrit, ittyadi ittyadi, kitni achhi achhi bhashaye hai are inko sikho. Jahan jaroori hai wahin Angrezi ka upyog hona chahiye bas. Lekin, jis bhasha ka na koi soor na taal. Eg, Put, Cut & But teeno ke alag alag pronunciation hai. Aisa kya ? Iska jawaab kisi Angrez ke pass bhi nahi. English mein 12 hazar shabh hai.

CM कमलनाथ ने कहा- किसानों का दमन बर्दाश्त नहीं, यह मेरी सरकार है
मध्यप्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री कमलनाथ ने अधिकारियों को चेतावनी दी है कि ये मेरी सरकार है, पुरानी सरकार नहीं, जहां किसानों के सीने पर गोलियां तक दागी गई. कानून व्यवस्था को बिगड़ने न दें.
मध्यप्रदेश में खाद की किल्लत झेल रहे किसान इन दिनों सड़क पर है. खुद कमलनाथ ने इस मामले को लेकर केन्द्र से चर्चा कर प्रदेश में खाद की उपलब्धता का प्रयास किया. इसी बीच किसानों के प्रदर्शन भी तेज हुए और सोमवार को स्थिति यहां तक निर्मित हुई कि गुना में बेकाबू किसानों पर पुलिस ने लाठियां भांज डाली. इसके अलावा राज्य के रायसेन, राजगढ़, विदिशा,छतरपुर, टीकमगढ़ और अशोक नगर में किसान प्रदर्शन करते रहे तो टीकमगढ़ में पुलिस के पहरे में खाद का वितरण किया गया. वहीं चुनाव के बाद कांग्रेसकी सरकार बनते ही शुरू हुई खाद की किल्लत ने राज्य में राजनीतिक आरोप-प्रत्यारोप भी तेज कर दिया. भाजपा ने कांग्रेस के खिलाफ एक तरह से मोर्चा खोल दिया और वह लगातार किसानों की समस्याओं को लेकर आंदोलन तक करने की बात कह रही है. किसानों की परेशानी पर राजनीति गर्माने और फिर सोमवार को पुलिस के लाठी चार्ज के बाद मुख्यमंत्री कमलनाथ की नाराजगी भी सामने आई.
कमलनाथ ने मंगलवार को एक के बाद एक दो ट्वीट किए और अधिकारियों पर नाराजगी व्यक्त कर उन्हें खुली चेतावनी दे डाली. कमलनाथ ने अपने पहले ट्वीट में कहा कि ‘प्रदेश में शीघ्र हल होगा यूरिया का संकट. किसान भाई परेशान ना हो. सतत प्रयासों से पर्याप्त मात्रा में यूरिया की उपलब्धता सुनिश्चित. यूरिया लेने के लिए आ रहे किसानों पर लाठियां बर्दाश्त नहीं. यह कमलनाथ की सरकार है , किसान हितैषी सरकार है. अधिकारी पुरानी मानसिकता बदले.’ पहले ट्वीट के बाद उन्होंने दूसरा ट्वीट भी किया जिसमें लिखा है कि ‘ यह पुरानी सरकार नहीं, जहां किसानों के सीने पर गोलियां तक दागी गयी. कानून व्यवस्था की स्थिति बिगड़ने ना दे, लेकिन किसानों का दमन बर्दाश्त नहीं. मेरी सभी जिम्मेदारों को खुली चेतावनी.’|Kabhi sangam vihar gayh ho ?

एक सज्जन कहने लगे- ""ई मोदी कुछ नहीं करता है । अबकी बार #BJP को वोट नहीं दूंगा।""
सच कहूँ तो मुझसे रहा नहीं गया, मैंने पूछा- ""आप मोदी से क्या चाहते थे जो आपको नहीं मिला..?""
