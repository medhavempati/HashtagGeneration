Позади всегда стена в реальную действительность. Впереди меньшее в стремлении не быть ещё меньшим. В восприятии мнить и жить этим. Лёгкая и просто устранимая. Обыкновенным плачем. Но кто-то испугал настолько что сознание возвело стену. Крепкую стену соорудив её из страха. Обложив себя им. Что делать когда оно уже не способно к восприятию активности сознания иного и многих в реальной действительности? Пребывая за стеной отрицания её отгородившись в сознании от реальной действительности страхом. Всё-таки заплакать и плакать долго. Избавляя себя от страха. Который необходим только для того чтобы сделать стену невосприятия к реальной действительности ещё крепче.|🖤🖤|So beautiful|Fashion Designing at sometime stopped further in imagination. Then began tinkering. So much so underclothes took top stage. Next visible anotomy to precedence. Not being satisfied the pregnant women's anotomy. Fabric and colours takes precedence.

I am an Iranian researcher and author.
My servant's name is (Honarparvar Tamiz).
I recently wrote a book titled «Death of Signs»:
This book is about semiotics and it is a science of semiotics supernatural and hidden combining linguistics phenomenology and psychology sprouting from the creative mind the deep thought and the shrewd thoughts of the designer.
Symptoms in the past have sometimes been visible and sometimes hidden from the symbols that were sending the message.
But nowadays despite all the hidden symbols in the height of disbelief like a blank letter envelope they are sending and transmitting an empty message !!!
This means that there are so many signs in our daily lives and that all segments of society use them at random and unconsciously so that signs are gradually becoming social behavior because neither the designer nor the target audience They do not have a proper understanding of the perception of the environment and the signs as they have become pervasive in the environment which initially causes the target and designer's intellectual death and subsequently leads to the death of the signs.
The author's entire speech is summarized in one sentence:
Signs are everything? But they are nothing!
Is it possible to do a slave book promotion in your page?

88,,,LIFE legend Ernest Hemingway was born 120 years ago today on July 21 1899 in Oak Park Illinois. He won a Nobel Prize in literature in 1954 and published many classics including The Sun Also Rises For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and the Sea - which was originally published in LIFE magazine in 1952. The image featured here is from that story in LIFE - a portrait of Hemingway at a Cuban fishing village like the one in his story.

This iconic photograph was taken by the great LIFE photographer Ralph Morse. No photographer spent more time with the Apollo 11 astronauts — especially in the months leading up to the history-making world-changing July 1969 moon landing — than LIFE magazine’s Ralph Morse who chronicled the crew’s public and private lives as rigorously as he’d done for earlier NASA missions. (Morse spent so much time with the Mercury 7 for example that John Glenn dubbed him “the eighth astronaut.”) #LIFElegends #Apollo11 #NASA #RalphMorse,lifelegends apollo11 nasa ralphmorse,"|My dad worked on the boosters for the Saturn V rocket in Huntsville AL in the early 1960’s.

I've seen the great importance of natural herbs and the wonderful work they have done in people's lives. I wonder why people still spend their money on surgery injections and drugs each time they are sick. Natural herbs can cure all kinds of illness including herpes diabetics asthma HIV hepatitis etc. I've seen it with my own eyes. I was cured of cancer and my aunt and her husband were cured of herpes by Dr Ehikioya who uses natural herbs to cure different kind of illness.

According to LIFE ""The photographs on these pages show an extraordinary rarity among birds a tame American bald eagle trained in the medieval art of falconry. The eagle is a 12-year-old female named Aguila. She was bought by her owner Dan Mannix for $25 10 years ago after being forced down in a New Jersey sleet storm her wings covered in ice. Since then Mannix an experienced falconer has moved to Malibu Calif. and every day he takes Aguila out into the hills near his home where for an hour or two of utter freedom she soars and wheels diving time after time on a leather meat-baited lure which he tosses in the air...This constant exercise keeps Aguila as strong and healthy as a wild eagle.""

111,,,"From the March 21 1960 feature shot by LIFE photographer George Silk - ""LOVELY LAND TOO FAR AWAY—A nostalgic photographer goes back to New Zealand to portray his spectacular and bountiful home country."" According to LIFE ""It is the nostalgic conviction of Photographer George Silk that absolutely the only thing wrong with New Zealand is that it is almost always too far from where he is. Silk was born in New Zealand and would be there yet but for the war and his profession which brought him to the LIFE staff in 1943.

It should be a smack in the face to the children and grand-children of every American who served in WW II.
But it’s apparently NOT the case.
My Dad and my hero, David F. Henrie, was one of the “greatest generation” with battle stars for the invasions of North Africa, Sicily, Salerno, Anzio and Normandy as a member of LCI(L) Flotilla 2. And I will never forget his graveside service and burial in Arlington. To this day, fifty-seven years later, the playing of TAPS is a severe emotional trial for me.
If I could, I would go there, kneel and tell him I love him and how proud I am as his son. I would also tell him how sorry I am to deal with some of the day to day events in America which today could seem at times to make serving one’s country a travesty:",10171

Happy birthday JFK. 
John F. Kennedy was photographed with Jacqueline Kennedy in 1957 at Hammersmith Farm in Newport Rhode Island and again in 1960 in his Senate office during his run for the Presidency. LIFE Magazine's memorial edition for John F. Kennedy after his death in 1963 would feature a different color portrait from the 1960 sitting. •

#死神博士 #shinigamihakase means Doctor ""Shinigami (the God of Death)"" in Japanese came to the Oval Office (along with other potential candidates) seeking to be named the #ChiefCabinetSecretary of Occupied Japan 51st state of the United States of America.
He had already been in that position for approximately 6 years
I told him NO.

Nobel Crooked ABE Prize Winner
Repost #trumpabe @generous89
It’s my sincere hope that the REIWA era the relationship with the great king of vassalage and service between the United States and Occupied Japan continue to grow deeper and stronger if that is possible.
""令和"" that is called REIWA in Japanese Name of new imperial era in Japan.
The name consists of two characters: ""REI"" which can have meanings related to ""order"" and ""WA"" usually translated as ""peace"" or ""harmony"" but obviously The REIWA era was named after
#清和政策研究会 the largest factions in which crooked belongs to in the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan.
After arriving in Japan I visited the Prime Minister’s official residence and met Crooked Abe and his wife Akie who is suspected of fronting for a large fraud group and involved in many other evil schemes Somehow Crooked could be able to suppress and cover up the case like Moritomo Gakuen scandals that is called #AkheedScandal #japanssecretshame and so on.
MAGA
'Make Asshole Great Again'
Superstition urban legend etc.

But I don't believe in a personal God to whom I look for comfort or for a natural on the next roll of the dice. I'm not unmindful of man's seeming need for faith; I'm for anything that gets you through the night be it prayer tranquilizers or a bottle of Jack Daniel's.

Неправильно. И Париж и вся Франция и вся католическая паства и целый культурно-просвещенный мир еще наверное нескоро полностью осознают всю печаль колоссальнейшей утраты которую понесло вчера всемирное человеческое наследие. По своему масштабу это сродни уничтожению Пальмиры. Но только Пальмиру стирали с лица планеты в военное время целенаправленно жестоко и демонстративно. Под прицелом видеокамер и глухое молчание западных лидеров. И что-то я не припомню чтобы кто-то из них сопереживал сирийскому народу или хотя бы выразил по этому поводу хоть какое-то сожаление. Поэтому товарищи коньюктуристы давайте впредь будем гуманнее и наконец осознаем то что мы не должны делить исторические ценности на наши и чьи-то там. Не молиться на коленях только когда горят наши храмы но и когда рушатся целые города древних цивилизаций. И давайте все вместе подумаем о том что наши потомки тоже имеют право созерцать красоту всего того что в свое время смогли видеть мы! Поэтому ребята давайте жить дружно 😉 и беречь нашу общую матушку-Землю ☝️☝️☝️
Искренне надеюсь что всеобщими усилиями Нотр-Дам восстановят! Держись Париж - мы с тобой!|Gorgeous!|Funny to see cars in front of the Cathedral ! Very different 50years later",36039

198,,,"The great LIFE photographer Margaret Bourke-White was in Tokyo in 1952 when she first discovered that in the middle of a physically demanding photojournalistic career the dull pain in her left leg was becoming something more. Rising from a meal she found herself for a few steps at least unable to walk. 
As she would recount in an extraordinary LIFE story seven years later it turned out — after years of misdiagnosis and confusion — that her brief stumble was a symptom of the onset of Parkinson's disease against which she would fight with everything she had for nearly two decades until her death at 67. It was as the introduction to that 1959 article noted the toughest battle ever faced by a woman who had seen many — including literal battles in World War II during which she served as the first woman accredited to cover the combat zones as a photojournalist. The photo seen here is an outtake from this incredible story shot by her good friend Alfred Eisenstaedt.

How about living the divine love like Feriduddin Attar Hadji Bektashi Veli and Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi by means of Uwaysi? 
This is certainly the route for ingenuity of Allah(Merit Way). There is no Shayh or any other involvement here.
There will be a couch guiding you through this route. And you will carry  on tracking the route by following the couch.
Without a doubt Merit Way is cure for every suffering. Why is it a cure?
Oh my friend! You have to be sure that if you turn your face towards Allah Allah will take every suffering out of your life. This is true only if you follow this road in order to meet Allah love Allah and gain Allah's concent.

I came from your tribe
Where the sun greets
To me every morning
And you send to the sea with a golden boad
The sun in your land
I planted
Wheat seeds in Dragon land
You grew 
It in the land of poetry
And he reaped
In the land of philosophy
I stay with you
When the polar star shines
And stars are singing
My song for you
I make a home in my heart for you.

PATRICK SE CELEBRÓ EN SAN AGUSTÍN DE LA FLORIDA EN 1597 POR EL PADRE IRLANDÉS RICARDO ARTUR?
Descubre las apasionantes historias de irlandeses en San Agustín de la Florida reveladas por el profesor #MichaelFrancis de la Universidad del Sur de La Florida: ""This morning as I read through hundreds of entries recorded by St. Augustine’s treasury officials one entry in particular captures my attention. It dates to August 22 1600 and records the purchase of some fabric and thread to be used to design a new dress for a Timucua Indian woman named Doña Ana the ruler of San Pedro (present-day Cumberland Island Georgia) and several other neighboring chiefdoms. Doña Ana had recently inherited the chiefdom and this was her first official visit to St. Augustine as San Pedro’s ruler.
To prepare for her visit St. Augustine’s governor summoned an Irish soldier/merchant named David Glavid from whom he purchased the fabric needed to tailor Doña Ana’s new dress. The forty-year-old Glavid who had lived in St. Augustine for just over three years presented the governor with some of his finest fabrics including yellow taffeta from China strips of yellow velvet and gold and silver thread.
An Irishman in St. Augustine
The real name of the Irishman who procured the material for Doña Ana’s outfit was Darby Glavin but to the Spanish in St. Augustine he was known as David Glavid or at times Davi Glavi.
One day I intend to write a book entitled Ten Colonial-Era Floridians I Wish I Could Have Taken to the Pub. David Glavid is one of them. Born in Ireland ca. 1560 little is known of Glavid’s childhood but by his early 20s he had established a career as a maritime merchant. In 1584 English corsairs captured Glavid’s ship as it sailed out of Britanny loaded with wine and other merchandise. The Englishmen seized the cargo and Glavid was forced to join Richard Grenville’s colonization expedition to Roanoke where he remained for a year and a half before Francis Drake’s fleet arrived in the summer of 1586 and transported the Roanoke colonists back to England. But Glavid did not remain in England l|👌|❤|👏👏👏👏👏😮😮|right wing #Non-Irish hooligans caused #thetroubles and are now the trouble in the #brexit|😎|My page is good for the soul and eyes|⚡|👀 looks and sounds great for the parade!!!|💚💚💚|follow us for impressing🙏 @icefiremood❤️|💂‍♀️💂‍♂️💂‍♂️💂‍♀️💂‍♂️💂‍♀️|🔑|Lovely post|💕|By @fun_nice_ph0tos_official 👋🏻🔥🤘|Need a Website ?

متن انگلیسی(Message of ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei Leader of The Islamic Republic of Iran)
*** In the name of God the Beneficent the Merciful
 To the Youth in Europe and North America
The recent events in France and similar ones in some other Western countries have convinced me to directly talk to you about them. I am addressing you [the youth] not because I overlook your parents rather it is because the future of your nations and countries will be in your hands; and also I find that the sense of quest for truth is more vigorous and attentive in your hearts.
I don’t address your politicians and statesmen either in this writing because I believe that they have consciously separated the route of politics from the path of righteousness and truth.
I would like to talk to you about Islam particularly the image that is presented to you as Islam. Many attempts have been made over the past two decades almost since the disintegration of the Soviet Union to place this great religion in the seat of a horrifying enemy. The provocation of a feeling of horror and hatred and its utilization has unfortunately a long record in the political history of the West.
Here I don’t want to deal with the different phobias with which the Western nations have thus far been indoctrinated. A cursory review of recent critical studies of history would bring home to you the fact that the Western governments’ insincere and hypocritical treatment of other nations and cultures has been censured in new historiographies.
The histories of the United States and Europe are ashamed of slavery embarrassed by the colonial period and chagrined at the oppression of people of color and non-Christians. Your researchers and historians are deeply ashamed of the bloodsheds wrought in the name of religion between the Catholics and Protestants or in the name of nationality and ethnicity during the First and Second World Wars. This approach is admirable.
By mentioning a fraction of this long list I don’t want to reproach history; rather I would like you to ask your intellectuals as to why the public conscience in the West awakens and comes to its senses after a delay of several de|علی سویزی:
I don’t insist that you accept my reading or any other reading of Islam. What I want to say is: Don’t allow this dynamic and effective reality in today’s world to be introduced to you through resentments and prejudices. Don’t allow them to hypocritically introduce their own recruited terrorists as representatives of Islam.
Receive knowledge of Islam from its primary and original sources. Gain information about Islam through the Qur’an and the life of its great Prophet. I would like to ask you whether you have directly read the Qur’an of the Muslims. Have you studied the teachings of the Prophet of Islam and his humane ethical doctrines? Have you ever received the message of Islam from any sources other than the media?
Have you ever asked yourself how and on the basis of which values has Islam established the greatest scientific and intellectual civilization of the world and raised the most distinguished scientists and intellectuals throughout several centuries?
I would like you not to allow the derogatory and offensive image-buildings to create an emotional gulf between you and the reality taking away the possibility of an impartial judgment from you. Today the communication media have removed the geographical borders. Hence don’t allow them to besiege you within fabricated and mental borders.
Although no one can individually fill the created gaps each one of you can construct a bridge of thought and fairness over the gaps to illuminate yourself and your surrounding environment. While this preplanned challenge between Islam and you the youth is undesirable it can raise new questions in your curious and inquiring minds. Attempts to find answers to these questions will provide you with an appropriate opportunity to discover new truths.
Therefore don’t miss the opportunity to gain proper correct and unbiased understanding of Islam so that hopefully due to your sense of responsibility toward the truth future generations would write the history of this current interaction between Islam and the West with a clearer conscience and lesser resentment.

308,,,"70 years ago this week ""TEEN-AGE FUN: PASSING THE RING"" was the December 20 1948 LIFE magazine cover story. This image ran on the cover. According to LIFE ""The ring game is not a game you can play all evening but it is always good for a lot of giggles. It is related to the old sniff game and the pass-the-match-box match game ans is one of the old pastimes which this year's teen-agers have rearranged to suit their taste. The boy and girl shown on the cover passing a ring from pencil to pencil are Jessamy Hines and John Shawver both 17 of Oklahoma City. If John and Jessamy should laugh and drop the pencil or let the ring slide off as it is passed around they are out of the game. The last couple is the winner.""

348,,,"This image was the PICTURE OF THE WEEK in the November 8 1948 issue of LIFE 70 years ago this week. According to LIFE: ""A New York City motorist can be loosely defined as a small body of protoplasm completely surrounded. He sometimes finds his front bumper overlapping the rear bumper of the car ahead and his own rear bumper overlapped in turn from behind. He is usually the width of a razor blade from the car at his right and on the left cars nudge his elbow as they whiz by in the opposite direction. Thus LIFE photographer Cornell Capa driving to Manhattan from La Guardia Field was not at all surprised by the 10-car pile-up on the opposite page. He jumped out and took a time exposure with streaks of light showing the headlights of the rest of the traffic streaming by.""

358,,,"Legendary photographer Ralph Morse was born 101 years ago today on October 23 1917 in Manhattan NY. The New York City native was LIFE's youngest World War II correspondent when the magazine hired him when he was just 24. He would make several of the defining pictures from that conflict -- and some of the most unsettling. He would go on to shoot for LIFE magazine for 30 years and covered the space race so closely that astronaut John Glenn dubbed him the ""eighth astronaut."" LIFE's longtime managing editor George Hunt reportedly once said: ""If LIFE could afford only one photographer it would have to be Ralph Morse."" Be sure to check out our Instagram story today for some of Ralph's amazing photographs as we celebrate his legacy. He is pictured here in 1943 on assignment in his Army uniform.

But when spring 1958 came round eight of the nine had successfully completed the school year.

I prayed for riches and achieved success;
All that I touched turned into gold. Alas!
My cares were greater and my peace was less
When that wish came to pass.
❤ 
I prayed for glory and I heard my name
Sung by sweet children and by hoary men.
But ah! the hurts – the hurts that come with fame.
I was not happy then.
💘 
I prayed for Love and had my heart’s desire.
Through quivering heart and body and through brain
There swept the flame of its devouring fire
And but the scars remain.
💞 
I prayed for a contented mind. At length
Great light upon my darkened spirit burst.
Great peace fell on me also and great strength –
Oh had that prayer been first!

Stokes wrote the Editors note for the issue featuring the story. Included in the note: ""When Shearer and I got to the prison about 5 a.m. the scene was threatening. Hundreds of state troopers wearing gas masks and gold riot helmets milled around the front gate illuminated by searchlight. Sniper squads of sheriffs and prison guards cradled deer riles with telescopic sights. It looked as if hunting season had opened early in Wyoming County. I felt there was an inevitability to it all.

You can see it on your NEWS AND NEWSPAPERS
We live in a global world when a day online can change your life for good
 You can be making $2850 with just $550 every week from forex option and it's not magic but logic.
Millionaires and billionaires don't depend on monthly pay but getting paid daily/weekly guaranteed them that title.

Why wait on 30days before you get paid instead of trying out FOREX OPTION where getting paid weekly is a MUST.

Millionaires and billionaires don't depend on monthly pay but getting paid daily/weekly guaranteed them that title.

Why wait on 30days before you get paid instead of trying out FOREX OPTION where getting paid weekly is a MUST.

480,,,"""Medgar was a happy man with a rich smile and a warmth that touched many people. He was never too busy to listen or too tired to help. But beneath that gentle sympathy lay strength that could not be intimidated. Lord knows enough people tried. But it never worked and that I suppose is why they killed him."" - Myrlie Evers LIFE magazine June 28 1963

55 years ago today on June 12 1963 civil rights activist Medgar Evers was fatally shot  in Mississippi by a member of the White Citizens Council. Evers was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. Pictured here is his widow Myrlie Evers comforting their son at his funeral. This image ran on the cover of June 28 1963 issue of LIFE.

489,,,"From the June 7 1948 issue 70 years ago this week LIFE featured a story on the Class of 1948. The photo essay by the great photojournalist W. Eugene Smith featured images of students from Cornell University in Ithaca NY. According to LIFE ""For the class of '48 the prospect for jobs and future is very promising. The class is the biggest in U.S. history: more than 250000 graduates."" This image ran in the story with the following caption: ""At Senior Picnic on the shores of Lake Cayuga Doug Foote raises his fraternity beer stein to toast a friend. This year's picnic featured all the beer a couple could drink for a dollar and was considered a partial flop when some of the beer was left over. Picnics are a favorite recreation at Cornell in the spring."" (W.

Who’s worse?? Both are just as guilty. . So please don’t preach to me on doing research. You have no idea the amount of time AND research I put in to try and help Stop Animal abuse. Unfortunately the  consumers are usually blind to what is happening to these animals until people like myself spread the word/information and enlighten them as to The atrocities that take place in these places. So again- yeah so I’ve done my research -& my feelings on the matter still strongly stand the same. Ringling brothers didn’t give a shit about those animals- all they care about was making money.

People should not forget that the last 6 years of her life were rather tumultuous and she was unfortunately out of it and hooked on barbiturates for most of it. So when you see photos of her from 1957-1962 (when she died) you’ll see weight fluctuations loss of the stunning luster she had in her youth and an increasing hollowness to her expression. All that said she was still stunning in her last years when you think about the fact that she wasn’t eating well wasn’t working out and mostly mentally out of it. People should also know that she was a voracious reader studied acting heavily to always improve sought intellectuals for companionship and had a tremendously difficult and unstable childhood and she overcame all of that to be forever remembered and emulated.

503,,,"60 years ago this week in the May 26 1958 issue LIFE featured a 15 page all color story on New England by the great photographer Dmitri Kessel - A HISTORIC REGION'S PRESENT CHARMS—HERE IS NEW ENGLAND AND WHAT TO SEE WHERE. According to LIFE ""Soon now the great summer tide of visitors will begin flowing through all of New England seeking many things. For some travelers it will be clean air and crisp nights for others the gentle valleys and mountain vistas or the surf pounding the craggy coast. For all it will be the pull of history everywhere in the region where so much of the nation's history is made."" This image was featured in the story with the following caption: ""A mirroring beauty in the window of a fishing shack shows off the small Maine village of New Harbor. Above and inside the window are bright lobster buoys and in the rippled reflection fishing boats ride at anchor. New Harbor off highway U.S. 1 is on the Pemaquid peninsula.""

584,,,"75 years ago this week LIFE published a photo essay in the March 8 1943 issue called ""American Sunday—LIFE Documents a Day."" According to the article Sixteen LIFE photographers (who could be spared from covering the war fronts) were dispatched around the country to document a single winter Sunday (Jan. 10 1943). They traveled from Maine to California and places in between. This photo by the great photographer Andreas Feininger was featured - the original caption reads: ""In New York City's Central Park people in overcoats stand watching the winter-hardy ducks and swans as the afternoon shadows lengthen. The row of apartment houses in the background of this picture marks the line of Central Park South; the figures in the upper left are skaters on one of the park lakes.

620,,,"70 years ago today Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was assassinated. This iconic photo of Gandhi at his spinning wheel was shot by the legendary Margaret Bourke-White in 1946. In typed notes that accompanied Bourke-White's film when it was sent from India to LIFE's New York offices in the spring of 1946 the significance of the simple spinning wheel in the photo is made abundantly clear: ____ ""[Gandhi] spins every day for 1 hr. beginning usually at 4. All members of his ashram must spin. He and his followers encourage everyone to spin. Even M. B-W was encouraged to lay [aside] her camera to spin. . . . When I remarked that both photography and spinning were handicrafts they told me seriously ""The greater of the 2 is spinning."" Spinning is raised to the heights almost of a religion with Gandhi and his followers. The spinning wheel is sort of an Ikon to them. Spinning is a cure all and is spoken of in terms of the highest poetry.""

637,,,"From the March 18 1946 cover story PARIS—It Belongs Also To Parisians. The image ran with the following caption: ""Montmartre under the chalk-white dome of Sacre Coeur was the Bohemia of Trilby's day and later a place of tawdry entertainment. Today is has again become what it was in centuries past—a village within a city. There are too few taxis now to take travelers up the steep hills to Montmartre and too few places of entertainment to persuade people to climb the long stairs and the wearying cobbled streets. The street painter now finds few foreigners to buy his pictures of the little curving street.""

664,,,"70 years ago this week in the Dec. 22 1947 Sports section LIFE ran a story about a SKIING Prodigy named Andrea Mead. At 15 years old she was the youngest to make the U.S. Olympic ski team at the time. This image opened the photo essay with the following caption: ""Her pigtails flying 15-year-ol Andrea Mead jams her ski poles into the deep powder snow and skillfully performs a difficult jump turn."" She would go on to compete in 3 Winter Olympics and was the first American alpine skier to win Olympic Gold medals (both in 1952 in Oslo).

677,,,"119 years ago today the late great LIFE photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt was born - on Dec. 4 1898 in Dirschau (Tczew) in West Prussia Imperial Germany.  He started working in photography in Weimar Germany in the 1920s. Having fled Nazi Germany in the mid-'30s he shot for LIFE magazine from its debut in 1936 until it ceased publishing as a weekly in 1972. He was one of the original 4 photographers hired by the magazine. After LIFE was shuttered Eisenstaedt kept photographing until the mid-1990s.
Small in stature dapper indefatigable—""I cannot believe that any photographer today works as much as I worked in the past"" he told an interviewer in 1993—""Eisie"" (as he was affectionately known) traveled the world making indelible portraits of famous people and places infamous scoundrels and anonymous (but through his lens immortalized) men women and children.

According to LIFE ""Even before the spring opening bugle has sounded at many tracks across the country race track plaids and checks are off to a fast start and running well. In a season where clear bright colors predominate the one new way of wearing conservative black brown and navy is by combining them with white in oversize checks and plaids. These bold patterns which are usually confined to country sports clothes are now turning up in city wear and have even been used in cocktail dresses.""

703,,,Inventor actress and LIFE legend Hedy Lamarr (Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler) was born 103 years ago today Nov. 9 1914 in Vienna. Lamarr’s beauty made it difficult to get much recognition for her brains. Along with the composer George Antheil she invented and patented a frequency-hopping technology that allowed missiles to go undetected. Though not implemented in time for use during WWII it did play a role in the Cold War even contributing to the deescalation of the Cuban Missile Crisis. She is pictured here in 1938 taken by one of the 4 original LIFE photographers Alfred Eisenstaedt.

This image opened the photo essay with the following caption: ""Uncle Joe Orr 95-year-old farmer who lives with his wife in a cabin on a mountaintop in the Blue Ridge occasionally joins in the mountain festivals with songs like the Boston Burglar.

741,,,132 black cats lined up to audition for the title character in Edgar Allen Poe’s 1843 short story The Black Cat in 1961. In the story the cat’s owner plasters him into a wall along with his murdered wife. Eventually the animal’s mewing from beyond the grave leads investigators to the woman’s body. The film adaptation which would appear in the 1962 horror compilation Tales of Terror adjusted the storyline by weaving in elements of another Poe tale. During the audition the owners took care not to let the black cats cross their path.

790,,,While the Vietnam War raged — roughly two decades’ worth of bloody and world-changing years — compelling images made their way out of the combat zones. On television screens and magazine pages around the world photographs told a story of a fight that only got more confusing more devastating as it went on. As Jon Meacham describes in this week’s issue of TIME the pictures from that period can help illuminate the “demons” of Vietnam. This iconic image known as “Reaching Out” from 1966 shows a wounded Marine Gunnery Sgt. Jeremiah Purdie (C) being led past stricken comrades after a fierce firefight for control of Hill 484 south of the DMZ during the Vietnam War. Now the debut of the Ken Burns and Lynn Novick series ‘The Vietnam War’ which premieres on PBS on Sunday and features 100 LIFE images like this one is bringing that period back into headlines. Throughout the series’ run LIFE will highlight a selection of these images on this feed and on LIFE.com.

801,,,"In the fall of 1959 the LIFE editors sent staff photographer George Silk back to his homeland of New Zealand. He brought back a spectacular set of color and black and white photos which were published in the March 21 1960 issue. This image ran with the following extended caption: ""New Zealand's ""Fujiyama."" Mount Egmont rises in symmetrical majesty above a bank of low-lying clouds and North Island's rolling Taranski district pastures some of the most fertile farmland on earth. Once these lands were densely covered with rain forests which the settlers cleared by felling and burning. After the lands were cleared the New Zealanders brought in poplars and pines from England to creat fast-growing hedgegrows to protect the cattle sheep and hay from the winds. The device incidentally created what looks like a replica of England's own gentle landscape. As a boy Silk skied on Egmont's slopes and climbed to the 8260-foot summit when he was 16. ""I was pretty thrilled"" he remembers. ""It may not be the tallest mountain in the world but there's nothing else high near it and you get an impression of tremendous height. It dominates the landscape for miles and it's a great sight no matter how often you see it.""

This image ran in the Sept. 16 1957 issue of LIFE with the following caption: ""Jeers from a girl Hazel Bryant (right) follow Elizabeth Eckford as she walks from Little Rock's Central High. Guardsmen barred her from school."" Although the Little Rock Nine were finally able to attend classes by late September 1957 the fight wasn't over: throughout the rest of the school year they faced ongoing abuse threats discrimination and acts of hazing from their white peers and disgracefully from equally vicious adults.

They used homemade sunscopes pinhole camera-like contraptions that indirectly project an image of the sun. According to LIFE ""To build your own get a carton and cut a hole in one side big enough to poke your head through. Paste white paper on the inside surface that you will be facing. Then punch a pinhole into the opposite side high enough so that the little shaft of light will miss your head. For a sharper image you can make a better pinhole by cutting a one inch square hole in the carton taping a piece of aluminum foil over this hole and then making the pinhole in the foil. Finally tape the box shut and cover all light leaks with black tape."" and of course “Don’t forget to come out for fresh air.” (Francis Miller—The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images) #1960s #solareclipse",1960s solareclipse,"|@eddie_mdez|@nicoleeeleee us in bpt|I remember doing that in grade school just about that same time|📸👌🏼|@summ_honeygirl @ben_shahbazi  @sam__shahbazi is working on contraptions!🤣😂🌞🌘🌓🌒🌑🌞|@_eric_baez|👍👍👍|So ready 🌚🌚🌚|💪|I'm just gonna look at it with my eyes.

This image ran in the photo essay with the following caption: ""Misery of the dispossessed is reflected in the face of this Moslem boy perched on the wall of the Purana Qila fortress in New Delhi. Below him thousands of his unhappy fellows who have fled their homes in terror are trying to survive until they can organize a convoy for the long march to Pakistan.

844,,,Alfred Eisenstaedt’s photograph of a sailor kissing a woman in Times Square after news broke of the Japanese surrender in World War II has lived a storied life since it was taken over 70 years ago. Often called “The Kiss” it remains the iconic image of celebration at war’s end a black-and-white bookend separating an era of darkness from the beginning of a time of peace. It is also an unsolved mystery of identity and more recently a source of controversy for those who see in it not mutual revelry but evidence of sexual assault. The debate continues.

Rather I am reminded of the manipulation used on this day by those who hate the United States. Those who refuse to acknowledge the full impact of the history they ignore. Those who would rather demonize a country who has made mistakes but has ultimately done good especially when compared to the alternative. Over the last few years we have seen what the world is capable of when the US steps back and takes limited or no action. Syria Russia North Korea and Iran and china on deck. Ask yourself this: would it be a better world without the United States? And who would protect you ultimately if the above are not kept in check?|@pcnordy there being sad pictures of Nanking (yes an atrocity) is NOT a refutation of my point: that the air attack on the pearl harbour military base and the atomic bombing of the city of Hiroshima are *not* equivalent.

Let's not forget the forced labor of Koreans and Chinese who died there too and on Battleship island. The comfort women. The millions of dead Chinese people. Tho before that the Chinese were killing themselves during their revolution and after during their civil war which is still unfathomable. Including the North Koreans invading the south and killing their own people after Japan did all this. And not forget the surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor and attacking Okinawa. An independent nation.

The rear view mirror of history is a wonderful way to learn what not to do going forward. I believe that President Truman was trying to end a bloody war (that killed 67million people) that he didn't start. He warned the Japanese and the decision makers there didn't relent. My father was a US Marine in Okinawa. He had been informed that he would be part of the invasion of Japan. 50k US soldiers were killed on Oki alone and 100k Japanese. So, yes, Hiroshima was a horrible event in history. I hope it never happens again. Truman was convinced that he could end the war and reduce the overall number killed. That's the info he had. 70 years of post war analysis has shown that conclusion not to be true. If only Truman could have waited 70 years to make his decision.....",26637

883,,,"From the August 8 1949 feature Art story - JACKSON POLLOCK—Is he the greatest living painter in the United States? According to LIFE ""Recently a formidably high-brow New York critic hailed the brooding puzzled-looking man shown above as a major artist of our time and a fine candidate to become ""the greatest American painter of the 20th Century."" Others believe that Jackson Pollock produces nothing more than interesting if inexplicable decorations. Still others condemn his pictures as degenerate and find them as unpalatable as yesterday's macaroni. Even so Pollock at the age of 37 has burst forth as the shining new phenomenon of American art."" (Martha Holmes—The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images) #LIFElegends #JacksonPollock #TBT",lifelegends jacksonpollock tbt,"|@njane5 your favourite artist|@anthonyshipp401 yeah but his traditional paintings are unremarkable. He's famous for doing something that I could train my dog to do.|He was an excellent artist. I love the simplicity if his art turning all of these self proclaimed art experts and art elitists on their heads. Even over a half a century later and he's still shaking you up.|@jackthelad16 Then why aren't you famous for it yet? Better get to training.|@leticiapaesdebarros|@anthonyshipp401 I'm saying he shouldn't be famous for knowing how to spill paint. I can't do the same thing he did to be a famous artist because it's already been done. He's a gimmick|Classic photo 😍|@jackthelad16 False he isn't famous because of the technique he's famous because people with similar views to you but with much more influence made such a big deal about it. And you most certainly could do the same. There are many famous artists that used very similar techniques to each other. Some of which even studied under the same professors.|@anthonyshipp401 that's reasonable. As I understand it his paintings now sell for quite a bit|top :)|It's alright though a lot of people feel the same about ""Fountain"" as well.|@withorwithoutu07 Correct I believe the last time one was sold it was 140 million. And who are you to tell someone what to do with their money. What if they buy art and donate their money to charities. Also just because his paintings were simplistic doesn't make him a heartless person. How do you know he didn't donate money?|Querido!!!|No relation.|👏 💐 💐|@parkerbanks modern art|Top notch....|You just said priorities. $50 painting or feed the homeless. Why not both. You need money to donate money.|Love him✴|@withorwithoutu07 I used to be heavily into street photography and would always carry extra gloves hats socks etc. with me in Boston in the winter in case I saw someone who needed them. And I sell prints in the $1000 range. So I'm still trying to understand your point about priorities. That to me is nonsense.|@kiernordli pollock|🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟|@withorwithoutu07 I know what you were referring to and I think you should be more concerned about your government's spending and how to help our own nation rather than be concerned about someone's personal purchases. There's a blurry line between a starving artist and a successful one. If you create something and someone buys it for their perceived beauty of it. Whether it's dripped paint ripped canvas or a painting that took years to make it's art.|@thehundreds|@abigailjbeck my uncle !!!|I don't think that he is that good of an artist.
