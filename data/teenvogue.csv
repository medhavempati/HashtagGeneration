Dear friend 🙏

I am writing this letter to you as you have a large audience in the international arena. The Azerbaijani side together with Turkey launched open missile attacks along the entire line of the Republic of Artsakh targeting also the peaceful settlements. All this can have very serious consequences.

Please use your resources to inform the international community about it. We are Armenians and we want peace. Now we are writing this message to all famous people in the world. We hope you do not ignore our request.

Maybe you have never had anything to do with Armenia or Armenians but here we are talking about ordinary human lives people who have become innocent victims of political clashes.

The joint call of all of you will definitely weaken the current aggression otherwise it may become dangerous not only for of the Caucasus but also for the whole of Europe.

We believe that you will help us to stop this inhuman evil. Thank you ❤

There was this day when he felt suicidal. He's been like that because in our highschool people get bullied base on their social status meaning that if you have very little likes you are left alone and unpopular. I know that sounds very odd but I tried my best to make my friend talk to a physicologist. The only thing I can do is to be there with him and tell him that likes is worthless. If you want to help you can like his recent post or talk to him about how worthless likes is, it will help a lot. His @ is @mateopinto._. Feel free to help and thank you so much",2785

3.103,,,"August 18 marks the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment — a celebrated milestone in the United States’ story of suffrage and of equal rights for women. But because of sexism immigration bans and a patchwork of other discriminatory state laws Native Black Asian and Latinx women were barred from voting well into the 20th century; even now many Americans of all gender identities remain unrepresented. For our August cover Teen Vogue is elevating the stories of women of color who have been disenfranchised and often written out of history but remain committed to a decades-long struggle to carve out a place in our imperfect democracy 💫

Why are thin white bodies always at the forefront of fashion trends? 

There was a post going around on social media of two plus size women wearing similar outfits however their images were used to make fun of their weight..... whereas if a model like Bella were to have worn the same thing she would have been praised as a style icon.

Images like these help to reinforce the narrative that in order to “look good” in clothing or to appear fashionable you need to be thin and white. 

I think it’s really just important that there is a level of diversity in the bodies that we are shown and also that where diverse bodies are used that it isn’t as a form of tokenism. 

I have read through the article and I know that there are plussized models used for clothing options 💚|icons 🥰|Why are they in a different order in the back ground than in the foreground picture|fav fit ❤️|❤️💘♥️🤩😍🤩♥️♥️|I’m so confused by this picture|Guys it’s edited relax|Glam 🔥🔥🔥|🔥🔥🔥🔥|Fashion trend for 2020: #WearADamnMask|When they’re all skinny 😋😋😋|Anna oops @haarmonies|jir kirain mrk jalan bareng|♥️❤️|Cute more skinny cis straight white girls on my fed during one of the biggest black lives matter movement 👏🏽|Sagittarius cancer and Libra|🔥✌🏻|@haileybieber 🤮|yaaas🤩|Awww 😍those 3|Cami❤️😍|Camila 😍😍|When they are friends with Camilla|❤️o|OMG CAMI😍😍|Check out our latest collection at @aboutthefit.store !

All lives matter yes that includes black lives|Everyone that is saying all lives matter I understand what you are trying to say but please learn why that’s not the right term to use right now. It’s not about every one right now it’s about the people being oppressed most people try to say all lives matter so they can reiterate that white lives matters toooo hello. When no one said white lives didn’t And  it’s not about white lives. It’s about the lives who don’t have the same freedoms and liberties as whites. Yes everybody matters but the point is the lives that aren’t mattering and aren’t being seen as important to everyone. That’s what it’s about.

The problem people have with BLM is what the movement pushes for like Marxism the some of there prominent leader are Marxist.|All lives matter! Black lives must be respected, the black community has gone through oppression and humiliation for centuries, showing that human race has failed the most important aspect of our essence, our knowledge that all humans must be treated as equals, simply because we are, despite our differences in each aspect.

I was annoyed with the network for canceling another show so I took a stand and refused to watch anything else they put on that channel. I was young and at the time it made sense. One night I was flipping through channels and I came upon this show and not realizing what it was I started to watch. It wasn’t so bad. I actually tried to catch up on other episodes but Penn Badgley is right it’s different for us the fans vs the actors. They had to live that time to go back and watch it would be a time capsule for them and I guess in a way it’s like coming across a random year book of yours and you really don’t know if you want to crack that spine open and let that flood of memories back in. So as much as I love all of these characters I respect the actors choices to move on and grow as individuals.|i hate dan @taladelapena|OMF.|😍😍😍😍|😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍|@hannahhu_|I'm watching it for the first time and im halfway through season 4|😍😍😍|you see the thing is i cant watch gossip girl anymore because i 'don't se Dan Humphry i see Joe Goldburg except we can't here his thoughts or everything he does|Are u serious?? :((|i just rewatched GG on netflix @adlineadlin|Nate Archibald❤|🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤|❤️❤️❤️|@maddilineberger|Penn Badgley looks like a douche in this pic|❤️🙌🏽|[redacted]|Their GLOW up is so good!|Omg 😭😭😭😭 @thisisjaywood|💗💗💗💗|🖤|aw they haven’t even watched gossip girl?|❤️❤️❤️❤️|@itsmetrixc 👏|@eiraspontes aaaaaah 😍|😍ñn|Gossip Girl one of my all time favorite series ever❤️❤️|Hi|😍|xoxo|😍😍😍😍|@amanda_miakos|❤️ Love that series please come back|🔥✌🏻|We need one with Ed|@alyssa0714|I’ve watched it like 10 times!!

3.157,,,It's July you say? Well the good thing is that #Pride can (and should) be a year-round celebration 💖 For Teen Vogue's #StatesOfPride 50 young people from across America shared with us what Pride means to them 🌈 #linkinbio,pride statesofpride linkinbio,"|Love 🙌🏽♥️🙌🏽♥️|🌈|ههههههههههههههههههههههههه 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂|Dear Teens of the World

As you may know most of us a stuck at home due to COVID-19. During this social distancing I decided to do a bit of math to help my fellow teens. For many teens that feel they will never be with the person they like I have some math to show you. The world’s population is 7.8 billion which is a lot. But see if you do some simple math you will find that 14 percent of the world’s population is between 10 and 19. That means that for all the people that are into girls there are 616008000 people around the world that you would eventually have a chance with. Now if you’re into boys that means you have 628992000 different options. Now I’m no math genius but that a lot of people. So teens before you get hung up on one person remember there’s a whole world full of people your age.

Sincerely a fellow Teen|🌈 ❤️❤️❤️",5770

The idea that we need media to look a certain way to prove our points shows me that no one is really ready to change what they post they want to change. Real change comes from acting in the community maintaining conversations that aren’t publicized and other things. Media is not a reality or full picture and is often privileged biased and misconstrued. I hate this rhetoric that blm even though media looks different. Well of course! If you depend on media to give you that warm and fuzzy feeling you have a really bad idea of how change is actually happening.|So true👏👏|ok|BLMMMMMMM we MATTER  TOO|✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾 Yes they do ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾|Preach!!!|🙌|Straight up‼️",37017

I'm sorry. To the young girls today and the women of tomorrow you deserve so much more than what is seen here today. NO ONE should feel ashamed for being put in a difficult situation. It is not your fault if you end up with child and you did not consent. It is not your fault if you are abused. It is not your fault that our system failed you. It's not your fault you had to make hard decisions surrounding abortions and child birth. It is not your fault that you don't have the means necessary to birth and raise a child. Know that NO ONE has control over your body and your life other than YOU. And don't let ANYONE tell you otherwise. If you've had to make a hard life decision know you made the right one at that time and place. You are doing your best.
